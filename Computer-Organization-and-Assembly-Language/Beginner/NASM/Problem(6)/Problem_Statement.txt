The program starts and waits for a keystroke from the user. Your program would handle only
5 of these keystrokes: key "a" for upper left part, key "b" for upper right part, key "c" for lower
left part, key "d" for lower right part and key "esc" to terminate the program. When an interrupt
is generated from the key press (either a or b or c or d), a timer is displayed in the respective
part of the screen and it keeps displaying till another key stroke (a,b,c,d or esc) is pressed. If esc
is pressed then the program would terminate, otherwise in case of key a,b,c,d the timer would
start again and displayed at the respective part of the screen.
