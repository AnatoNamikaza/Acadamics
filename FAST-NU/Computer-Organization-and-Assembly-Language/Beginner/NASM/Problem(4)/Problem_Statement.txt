Write a program that displays two character (i.e., character 1 and character 2) of your choice at
the middle row of the screen. One character is on the left most side, and other one is at the right
most side of the same row. Write a program that moves character 1 to the right, and moves
character 2 to the left. Your program should stop when both the characters are adjacent to each
other.
