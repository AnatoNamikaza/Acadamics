Q1)
a)
Draw RNN architecture diagarm and wirte equeation along with dimensions of all layers 
and weight matrices for the following.
Suppose the input words are one hot encoded vectors,
input sequence of lenght 3 (lets say 3 words)
hidden layer units are 5
embedding size  (dense word vector dimensions) = 6
V = vocabulary = 8



Q2)
a)
Draw neural network (for the task of neutral language model) architecture diagarm 
and write equations along with dimensions of all layers and weight matrices for the following.
Suppose the input words are one hot encoded vectors.
input sequence of lenght 3 (lets say 3 words)
hidden layer units are 5
embedding size (dense word vector dimensions) = 6
V = vocabulary = 8



b)
what are total number of parameters for the above architecture?
