Q1)
a)
Draw RNN architecture diagarm and wirte equeation along with dimensions of all layers
and weight matrices for the following. Suppose the inout words are one hot encoded vectors,
input sequence of lenght 4 (lets say 4 words)
hidden layer units are 5
embedding size  (dense word vector dimensions) = 6
V = vocabulary = 9





b)
What are total number of parameters for the above architecture?
Ans: 154

c)
What are total number of parameters if the number of input words increase to 10?
You do not need to draw architecture for 10 words, you can answer using information from the above equation.
Ans: 154

Q2)
a)
Draw neural network (for the task of neutral language model) architecture diagarm
and write equations along with dimensions of all layers and weight matrices for the following.
Suppose the input words are one hot encoded vectors.
input sequence of lenght 4 (lets say 4 words)
hidden layer units are 5
embedding size (dense word vector dimensions) = 6
V = vocabulary = 9



b)
what are total number of parameters for the above architecture?

c)
what are total number of parameters if the number of input words increase to 10?
You do not need to draw architecture for 10 words, you can answer using information form the above quesiton.
