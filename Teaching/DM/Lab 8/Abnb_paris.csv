My wife and I stayed at the writers studio in marais for 10 days. It was an amazing trip and the place was perfect. It was in a perfect location central to everything and found marais to be the perfect area to end our day with a meal and a drink. Nicolas communicated well and met us onetime for the key. We would definitely stay again.
My mother and I had a fantastic time staying in this apartment. It is so central, we were able to walk everywhere- we didn't have to catch the metro once! The apartment was great for what we wanted- just somewhere to leave our bags, to bring back food from the markets and have a quick bite at home before going out again. It was the perfect space for two people.
Have just returned home after a month long trip to France. The trip was fantastic and that expereince started off from the outset when we spent five days in this apartment. The location is perfect with everything within walking distance or a short metro ride. The apartment is clean and quaint and is as depicted in the pictures, albeit somewhat darker as the lighting is minimal. If you want to get a feel for Paris life rather than a impersonal hotel room this is an ideal choice. Equipment wise the apartment could be better equipped with mugs, plates and glasses but this didn't really cause a problem, as who really wants to eat in when cafes and restaurants abound within a few feet of the door (some matching wine glasses would have been nice though). Nicolas was a lovely friendly host, he communicated quickly and promptly. Checking in on Sunday (and later than planned) didn't seem to be a problem for him and the bottle of wine on arrival was a nice touch. In short a great apartment in a great location and served by a great host.
The apartment is great, very charming and an astounding collection of books. Location was pretty awesome too, right beside Place Pompidou. Communicating with the host (Nicolas and Alex) was easy and quick. Great experience!
Nicolas was an excellent host, the apartment was as beautiful as the pictures present it and he was very easy to communicate with. Our entire experience was very enjoyable. The area was nice and central but a little noisy at times. I would definitely recomend this host to others.
Had such a great time in Paris, this apartment is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who wish to stay in the center of Paris.
The Marais Writer's Studio literally is quite stunning! It is a very quaint and antique filled apartment that I thoroughly enjoyed staying in. It is very well situated and the Metro is only a swift walk away (5-10min max). The apartment had everything we needed - we especially loved the coffee and juice machines!! Although not a problem at all for physically able people, I would recommend looking at Nicolas' other beautiful apartments if you are less able or struggle with a loft ladder to get to bed. This certainly was not a problem for us, in fact, we were very impressed with the use of space the loft created. Nicolas was very lovely and a breeze to communicate/coordinate with. I will definitely recommend and hope to stay in one of Nicolas' apartments once again.
Great position, walking distance to most of the usual sight seeing and shopping. Added bonus though is you are also close to some interesting slightly more alternative options where you can eat, shop and visit as well. Very close to several metros and the major RER hub at Chatelet Les Halles. The apartment itself is fantastic, very French, clean, comfortable and quiet. Internet access and washer/dryer facilities very handy. The host Nicolas was great, very understanding when I had a few personal issues before arrival. Would highlyrecommend to friends this apartment, this area and this host.
The Writer's Studio in Marais was lovely and exactly as described. We had a great 7 day stay in the studio, it was located near the Metro stations, and within walking distance to all the locations we were interested in. We were a group of 3, and I felt the Studio had ample space for all 3 of us. The futon downstairs was comfortable and I got some great sleep on it. Communication with Nicolas was easy, and the flexible check in and check out process was very helpful. All our expectations were met, Nicolas was a great host. Thank you Nicolas for the bottle of wine as well. There are affordable places to eat and drink and small grocery stores VERY close by walking distance. Tip: If you intend on using the washing machine, make sure to ask Nicolas how to use it. It can be tricky to figure out as the settings are all in French

My husband, daughter, and I recently stayed at """"Cosy"""" for a long weekend in Paris. The apartment was very nice and the St. Germain location was perfect. Thanks Nicolas for a wonderful stay!
We stayed four nights with two teen age boys. It was a very comfortable apartment including the sofa bed. It is very well located close to the underground station Cardinal Lemoine. It is also quiet at night,clean and very safe. If there was anything to change I would add a small wardrobe to hang clothes if people were staying longer. I would recommend the boulangerie close by that makes great chaussons aux pommes and croissants for breakfast. Restaurants are better at the bottom of the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine and also not to forget the market rue Moufetard. We would stay again, Merci Nicolas et Santiago
NICOLAS MET US ONTIME AND SHOWED US AROUND THE APARTMENT. THE LOCATION IS EXCELLENT, IT IS SAFE AREA, AND WE REALLY ENJOYED OUR STAY.
Good apartment, excellent location, easy to access as its on ground floor, more spacious than a hotel room and clean and convenient as has everything necessary - from table to small kitchenette. Nicolas was easy to deal with, prompt replies and we had no problem checking in and checking out. Would stay here again!
The apt was exactly as described and the location perfect for getting to the Louvre, Tuileries, d'Orsay, etc.. We were able to walk to everyplace of interest. For us, the best features were that it was very quiet (ground floor), modernly furnished, modern bathroom and had a big comfortable bed (hard too find that in Paris). Working with Nicholas was very easy, he accommodated our schedule for key pickup and checkout. Definitely recommend this apt and Nicholas. Hope to visit again!
This is a wonderful apartment in a charming and convenient neighborhood. It is really as described. Nicolas was very accommodating and all went smoothly. I stayed there with my husband and 10 year old son and it was perfect. We would definitely return. Many thanks.
i will write very honestly. first, the flat is not exactly like on the picture. the sofa is old and a bit dirty , and no sofa table which they just put a box with one wooden board... the flat is nice, good to live for one person. i like the most is all the sound system. but... when i check in, the flat was not clean.... dirty food in the frige. Nicolas sent somebody to clean after. he did came once when i could not connect the wifi. he helped for it. but there was one broken light in kitchen, he said he will come to fix it but never came in one month....the bed is also not exactly like on the picture either...one convinient is very close to Gare du nord. but i didnt like the aera....
Nicolas's flat was as promised. Modern, clean lines and the added bonus of being in a gorgeous old building on one of the nicest streets in st germain. I was met promptly, given keys and a tour of place and enjoyed a fabulous week in my very own home in Paris. Will definitely book again. Thanks heaps
Nicolas is a great host! The apartment is on the ground floor and very clean. We had a great time staying at Nicolas's apartment. Location is perfect to see everything in Paris - an easy walk to everything in St Germain des Pres, easy walk to Notre Dame, Ile de la Cite, Louvre, Musee D'Orsay, Invalides, etc."

Thank you for a wonderful stay in your apartment! We were very impressed with the standard and loved the rain water shower and little balcony. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and everything well cleaned. Basically we loved it! Once we navigated our way around the Parisian backstreets we greatly appreciated the awesome location...just got lost a few times on our own accord. Would happily recommend this place to everyone ☺
The place is really nice. The location was perfect for us. It is close (15min walk) to train station North. Arthur was clear in the communication and Manuela, who received us, was really nice.
Arthur's apartment was so beautiful and she was extremely helpful in getting us situated comfortably into the area/building. The apartment had everything we needed and it was very relaxing. Definitely recommended!
We really enjoyed our stay in Paris. The room was modern, nice, warm and cosy with a great shower, and all amenities required. The neighborhood was great and conveniently located so we barely used public transport. Arthur was quick to respond to all inquiries and was really helpful, though we only saw him on the first day. Would recommend to others.
I booked two rooms in this apartment and this is for my friends' short stay. Well equipped with own shower, sink and also toilet. Everything is great and it is nice for us to be able to leave the luggage until leaving in the evening.
Arthur was really friendly and nice. The room was amazing. The localitation of the room was great, really close frome Cadet and Grand Boulevars subway, like 10 min. from the city center. 20 min from Torre Eiffel. Everything in París was great!!!!!! I'm want back really soon and if I do I'll repeat in Arthur's appartment.
The location is convenient and close to 2 Metro stations, where there are bakeries, supermarkets and restaurants nearby as well. There is lift in the building and we were on the 5th floor with a very good view on the classic Parisian streets. The room is nice and comfortable, everything is same as the description, we have a nice stay there for 6 nights. We met Arthur on our last day, he is a very nice host. He helped to keep our luggage till we back from our last visit in Paris, thanks!
On a passée une très belle vacance dans un véritable relax en campagne. La maison était parfaite et bien équipée. L'endroit est franchement un des plus beau qu'on a vu en France.
I have spent 4 nights in Arthurs appartment with my 3 girlfriends, as we came to celebrate my birthday. The location is fantastic, flat is cosy, clean and modern, fully equiped. And our host - Arthur, not only he carries big heavy suitcases easilly, but knows the best restaurants nearby!
Super Gite. Parfait pour passer quelques jours à la campagne et vraiment très proche de Paris. Pizzeria bio très sympa juste à côté pour le soir d'arrivée. Maison calme et très agréable. A recommander. Nous y reviendrons sans doute!
It was a great visit. The apartement was everything it was said to be, and Arthur was a very nice host.
Bel appart Réception pro Séjour top!
Bonjour Arthur!! Notre séjour fut dès plus agréable sur le port de Cassis. La vue de l'appartement offre le loisir de pouvoir profiter du port sans les nuisances. L'appartement est meublé avec beaucoup de gout.
Top !
Feel like home : parenthèse enchantée ! Emplacement géographique central et idéal pour visiter Paris, quartier calme tout en étant à quelques rues, très animé, """"secure"""" pour les sorties nocturnes, voisinage de l'immeuble plutôt familial et cool. Appartement super cosy, décoré avec goût et une grande sensibilité esthétique qui fait se sentir """"comme chez soi"""". Très fonctionnel et optimisé au niveau des espaces de vie, ouverts, lumineux et pensés dans un esprit convivial. Canapé lit autant que le lit de la chambre parental super confortables. Arthur, adresse au top et alignée avec votre sympathique accueil et réactivité à travers nos échanges par mail, un grand Merci !
Superbe maison pleine de charme, dans un très joli cadre paysager. Idéale pour s'aérer à la campagne.
Un appartement chaleureux, où tout est bien pensé et avec goût. Tout est fait pour se relaxer (avec un bon feu d'hiver) et se sentir chez soi. Une vue apaisante et une magnifique terrasse. Appartement avec une situation idéale. En partant, on pense déjà à la prochaine réservation !"

Lovely apartment to stay in Paris. Lea's communication was fabulous as was her lovely friend Maud whose friendly welcome was much appreciated after a long drive! Apartment clean, well appointed for the 10 of us and a very easy place to stay with children. Thank you for having us!
Very good Place to stay. Close to important locations. The apartment is small but with everything we need.
Lea was very helpful and welcoming. Just arrived there was a small problem with the hot water but Lea was very attentive and she had already organized an intervention that she has followed personally. The apartment was clean and equipped. A great stay!

Lea was great at communicating before our stay and her husband was very helpful when we checked in. We really liked the area - the only thing I would say is that there isn't a great view from the apartment which we expected from the photos.
What a great little place :) quiet, clean and very well located. Matt was very welcoming and helpful. Would definitely stay here again!
Lea was so friendly and helpful and her little flat was amazing. I can only give her my best recommendations.
Séjour parfait, merci Léa.
It's a very cozy apartment and in a great location. Lea is very friendly and she's easy to reach if needed. She gave us great recommendation for lunch spots! One thing though, it's some narrow spiral staircases that lead to the apartment so people with large luggages might find it difficult. It wasn't a problem for us and once we are in the apartment we felt very relaxed because of the simple but charming decor and comfy sofas and bed.
We had a fabulous stay in Lea's gorgeous Parisian apartment. The apartment was much bigger then we expected and the photos do not do it justice. Lea was lovely and extremely responsive to all of our correspondence. I would highly recommend this apartment as it is beautiful, and truly Parisian chic. This is a fabulous apartment.
Lea was the kindest host and the apartment was immaculate and had everything I needed for my stay. The neighborhood is wonderful too. I would stay at Lea's place again in a heartbeat."

With a bottle of wine as a welcome present, we had a great start. All Paris' sights are just a few Metro stations away. You can even walk there - we actually strolled to the Seine the first evening. Near the apartement, you have supermarkets (even in sundays) and with a short walk to the Marais, lots of bistros and restaurants. The apartement is very well equipped. There's even a washing machine! TV (we didn't use it, though, Paris alone was more than enough), Internet. A very comfy, big bed with big linens. It really has been a pleasure to call this """"ours"""" for a few days. Thanks so mich, Eric, and a big recommendation for everyone else!
We spent 3 nights in this nice apartment. It is perfect for 2 persons and it had everything you need. Our host was very nice and courteous. Contact with Eric is very easy and he usually answers really fast. The location of the apartment is perfect. This part of Paris is charming and invites to be explored by walking around. Everything you need for living is close to reach. If you are in the mood, you even can walk to Notre Dame and Centre Pompidou (30-45 minutes). All in all it was a perfect trip for us, thanks to our nice host and apartment. We would like to come again!
This is a really wonderful place to stay in. The location is good, with restaurants and shops all around. It is also within walking distance to the main tourist attractions. We met the host and he was very friendly and thoughtful as well with a couple of books that showed us where to go within Paris. Highly recommended!!
eric is a great host! the apartment was comfortable, clean and well equipped. The location of the apartment is just great, we enjoyed our time in paris very much. I just can recommend the charming studio to everyone.
Charming is the perfect word to describe this studio loft. Very compact yet so bright and fresh. It feels very comfortable, safe, and authentic. Eric was an outstanding host. He is very friendly and communicative, guiding us through the process efficiently and without being overbearing. He even brought us a bottle of wine on our second night in the apartment. In terms of locations, this apartment is absolutely central. In the Marais are tons of great cafes and bars, and in just a few minutes you can walk to Notre Dame. I can't imagine finding a better location at this pricepoint. We certainly recommend this apartment to anyone looking for an entirely unique and authentic approach to their time in Paris. Eric
Eric was a great host and very accomodating. He greeted us and showed us aroud the apartment and apartment building upon our arrival. The apartment was nice and clean. The bed is lofted, and has a ladder to get to the loft, but this allowed for more space in the living room which was great. Shower and bathroom were nice and had hot water! Location was great, we walked almost everywhere, but there is also a metro station very close by.
Hey everyone! The location of the apartment is great, you can get almost everything by walk. Eric is always reachable if u need some advises or u have done questions. The street is nice and quiet. You will enjoy staying there:)
Eric was a great host. His communications and directions were excellent. He got back to me right away whenever I had questions and was very helpful. The little apartment was just perfect. The bed is very comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with everything I needed. And it's location in Paris was very convenient, plus the area is beautiful. I really enjoyed my visit.
Eric's flat is in a great location, next to le marais and republique. Communication is great and you can easily go to other parts of Paris. The bed is very comfortable and the facilities in the apartment are good. The bathroom is a bit small but it's clean and it's enough for a few days. Price, for Paris, is great. I rreally recommend to stay here.
We are 2 students and had a brilliant stay in this apartment. Although it is small, it is within walking distance of lots of tourist sites and bars, and very easy to get the metro to everywhere else we wanted to go. Eric was very friendly and helpful, and we would recommend him highly!"

Estuvimos muy contentas en el estudio de Sara. La ubicación es estupenda en un barrio muy alegre y bonito, lo que hace que la experiencia de visitar Paris empiece muy bien. La calle es bastante ruidosa pero sobre las 11 pm los lugares cierran y todo se calma. El wifi muy bien. Nos ha gustado, volvería.
I really recommend to stay at Sara's place while you're visiting Paris. Sara is very nice and flexible about arrival and departure times. The apartment is cozy, bright and clean and has everything you need. It is placed right in the centre of the Latin Quarter in the charming Rue du Pot de Fer where a lot of nice bars, restaurants, creperies etc are (website hidden). Monge is a 2 min walk away and from there, there is a metro station so it is easy to commute to anywhere in Paris. Getting there from the airport is easy as well as the Luxemborg station is only a 10 min walk away and from here you can take the RER B line to either CDG or Orly. So all in all Sara's apartment is definitely the place to reside while you're in Paris. Cheers Martin
The apartment has a perfect location. It is located in the quartier latin near bars and nice restaurants . It is small, clean and quite equipped. However the coach is very uncomfortable and I wouldn't recommend it for sleep. Sara was nice and communicative although she got into the apartment twice.
Une nuit passée avec une communication efficace avec l'hôte. Studio légèrement bruyant et canapé lit peu confortable. Sara est une personne accueillante.
My friend and I had a great stay here..great location close to lots of places to eat, and Sara is very kind and helpful.
Tout simplement parfait! Appartement charmant,propre,situé dans un tres chouette quartier. Accueil sympathique. Sara était très accessible. Comblée mon séjour etait top! Je recommande et retournerai volontiers chez Sara pour ma prochaine escapade! Merci Sara.
Sara's flat is great. It was my first airbnb experience and it was more than I wished for! The flat is well located in the 5th quarter of Paris, which is also known as The Latin Quarter. It is not that touristy as other parts of Paris' center, and there's a lot of bars, cafe's, restaurants, supermarket, boulangeries and patisseries right across the street and around the apartment. The Place Monge metro station is within 3 minutes walk and gets you directly to the most touristy parts of the city. The flat is very very clean, there's TV and a well equipped but small kitchen. Sara was very communicative, helpful and flexible with late checkouts and stuff. In my opinion the flat is more suitable for one person. If you arrive in Paris, I'm telling you - book Sara's place. The area is awesome and the flat has everything you need. You won't be disappointed.
I loved staying in Sara's cozy apartment. It's located in a gorgeous pedestrian zone in the heart of Paris with beautiful little streets full of restaurants, bars and shops. Sara is incredibly nice and takes good care of her guests. I certainly recommend this apartment.
Very well located apartment in the center of Paris, in a full of live, restaurants and shops street and close to public transportation. The flat is small but very cozy and well equipped (even with a Nespresso coffe machine). Just keep in mind this is a 5th floor without elevator. About Sara, she is a great hostess, very kind and helpful.
a very clean and comfortable place in a superb Paris location. I was there for just one night but it worked out very well for me. thanks Sara!!
Idéalement situé dans un des quartiers les plus prisés de Paris, l'appartement bénéficie d'une très belle luminosité. Très propre et très pratique, il correspond réellement aux photographies présentées par le site. Sara est une personne très sympathique et surtout très disponible. C'est vraiment une qualité. Alors, Sara, encore merci pour votre accueil. Je recommande particulièrement cette location.
Je suis ravie de mes deux nuits passées chez Sara. Elle était indisponible et c'est un ami qui m'a chaleureusement accueillie. Cependant Sara est toujours joignable sur son portable. L'appartement est tel que décrit. Attention cependant pour les personnes à mobilité réduite, il se situe au cinquième étage sans ascenseur. Merci encore Sara .
The location is perfect! Centrally located in the area of Saint Germain des Pres and also very near the metro station. Literally a stone throw from the major department store of le bon marche and other cafe which deeply reflects the typical Parisian atmosphere. Sara was a great host who has been very responsive and able to provide solution actively in the event there is a problem. Will definitely come back if possible!"

Chambre très calme et hôtesse extrêmement accueillante. Pour ma première expérience Airbnb, ce fut une réussite.
Jane is a nice, elegant lazy. Her house is well decorated like an art museum! And the bed is super cozy!! I love the proud cat named Max:) Good location ,closed to 2 metro stations. Nothing to complain.
Quelle hôte exceptionnelle! Le petit déjeuner qu'elle avait préparé lui ressemble: bio, beau, bon…….danois! Toujours disponible pour partager ses adresses, ses bons plans, génial!!!
J'ai passé une nuit chez Jane et j'ai apprécié l'accueil simple et chaleureux de Jane et de sa fille. J'ai passé un séjour très agréable et je l'en remercie.
Jane was a fantastic host and we had a lovely long weekend away staying in her apartment. If you want to really feel Paris, this is the place to stay. Great location, comfy bed, amazing breakfast, a perfect weekend away.
J'ai réservé la chambre chez Jane pour une escapade de mes parents à Paris. Je recommande vivement. Jane m'a appelé pour répondre à quelques questions avant que je ne réserve et m'a tenue informée à plusieurs reprises par téléphone, s'est montrée très accueillante avec mes parents (un GRAND MERCI Jane !) pour qu'ils passent un très agréable séjour (ce qui fut fait). Une très très bonne expérience à renouveler. Jane mange tak for din gæstfrihed
First airbnb experience at Jane's and i don't think i'll ever book a hotel anymore! Simply perfect: it felt like being home, personable, peaceful, yummy food, great value! Well done Jane!
De passage en coup de vent sur Paris pour un concert, j'ai eu le plaisir d'être accueillie avec beaucoup de chaleur et de gentillesse par Jane. Ses conseils ont bien facilités mon séjour et mes déplacements. Petit déjeuner généreux et Bio! Le cadre est à l'image de Jane agréable, fin et délicat. De retour sur Paris, je ferai très vraisemblablement appel à elle. Carole.
Quel accueil!!! Je suis passée en coup de vent ce qui est dommage mais j'ai beaucoup apprécié l'appart, sa localisation et mon hôte. Un petit déj de folie en fort agréable compagnie :-). Je conseille et je referais si j'en ai l'occasion :-)
Fantastic stay with jane. Lovely apartment, lovely part of Paris and ideal hosting. Could not have asked for anything more.
We really felt at home in the nicely decorated appartment. The bed and the additional matress are super comfortable, that compensates the small shower, the balcony with afternoon sun is lovely and the location is great. Thank you, Jane!
After a little bit of difficulty finding the place, my sister and I both agreed that we could not have stumbled upon a more perfect location to spend our week in Paris! Jane waited for us so we could grab the keys, even though we were several hours late (problems at the airport, and then difficulty navigating Paris -- protip, the street signs are on the buildings), so she is basically a saint. The apartment is tiny and lovely (the bathroom is seriously small, but totally serviceable), and what it doesn't have in spaciousness it more than makes up for with its incredible balcony and prime location. It was perfect for us because it was near so many awesome things (a 30min walk to the Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysees, and 40min to Notre Dame), and a few Metro stops that will get you anywhere else your heart desires. As an added bonus, three blocks away on Rue Babylone there is an EXCELLENT coffee shop (a rarity in Paris) called Cafe Coutume. My sister and I, desperate for some good joe, went there every morning -- and on our last visit, the manager knew our drinks and had them ready for us before we even ordered. Such a wonderful experience, and a fantastic way to end our stay.
Good apartment and location, however, the host was an hour late to give me the keys and she rushed us out when leaving. Not the best.
This was a great apartment. We really loved the area, it was convenient for both Vaneau and Duroc metro stations and close to the centre of Paris. It was comfortable and it felt very Parisian. The kitchen is small but well equipped and balcony was lovely!
excellent séjour chez Jane, c'est mon 2eme !!! Jane est une excellente hôtesse, la chambre est très confortable et calme le petit déjeuner est super
Jane was a terrific hostess: our incoming flight was very delayed but she patiently waited for us to get there. The apartment was perfect for us - parent and teen, who is something of a homebody. We could read on the sofa or balcony, cook in the (small and improvisation-inspiring) kitchen and even spend a couple of evenings at home happily. The location is perfect too for walking around. Thank you!
We stayed in the apartment for 3 days. Prior to our arrival I emailed Jane to ask directions from the station to which she replied promptly, I also asked if there was a hair dryer and Jane said she could supply one, which she did. The apartment is in a very good location. The neighbourhood is safe and quiet. There are all of the shops you need just at the end of the road, 2 minutes away, as is the Metro station. Jane met us at the apartment on arrival and handed us the keys and explained the wi-fi etc. The living room is very small. The bathroom is tiny. The bedroom a reasonable size and the kitchen is only adequate for 1 person to be in. Pros: Location, the balcony, the neighbourhood, the apartment is clean and the bed is super comfortable. Things you should know: there is no kettle, toaster, frying pan, microwave or oven. The kitchen is a sink, 2 rings, a cooker hood and a fridge. Ample crockery and cutlery is supplied along with 2 saucepans, a grater, colander and chopping board. There is no TV. Lots of tea towels and towels are supplied. Its quite a hike up a spiral staircase to the apartment. The shower is very small, I'm small but my husband is almost 6ft and found it awkward to turn around in the shower. It's peaceful and after 2 full days of sightseeing a great nights sleep was most welcome. If I visit Paris again I would prefer a few more amenities and a little more room, having said that it was clean, Jane was very pleasant and for location alone this apartment is worth using.
Dejlige 4 overnatninger i en meget lille charmerende lejlighed, der ligger i en stille gade, tæt på metro stationen Vaneau, og i gå afstand til Invalide kirken og Eifeltårnet. Fint at der var Wifi i lejligheden. Hvis man skal manøvre rundt på badeværelset, skal man dog ikke være en størrelse XL. ;-)).
We had a very pleasant experience! We arrived in the morning, and Jane offered to let us leave our bags with her and go explore the city while we waited to check in. She gave us lots of ideas as to what we could see and do, and showed us where the best spots are on a map. She is very sweet and kind, and has lived in Paris for 25 years. The flat has a good view and a balcony. It is located on a quiet but safe feeling street. There is a beautiful courtyard downstairs at the entrance. The bedding was very comfortable and the apartment charming! Bon voyage! :)"

She helped us do laundry, print documents for travel, and gave us a lovely French breakfast each morning. I cannot describe how utterly happy we were from our stay. I definitely recommend this place for anyone!
Nice stay! Good location!
We had a very pleasant stay. The room is as described and the appartment is located perfectly to get around the city by metro. We had a key to the appartment so we were totally flexible about when to leave and come. I highly reccomend this to everyone.
Ce fut notre première expérience Air Bnb et nous avons été ravis ! Maguy est une hôte très agréable et sympathique, et très disponible ! La chambre était très confortable et propre, et surtout calme ; l'emplacement est idéal !
Staying at Maguys was great! She is a lovely host. Everything is really tidy and clean and Maguy can give you good advise on how to get around in Paris. She even gave us maps and guides for the city to use during our stay. Really recommendable!
We had a great time at Paris. The apartment was fine and we had everything we needed.
Very nice stay in Paris, perfect location. The room is nicely equiped and very quiet. Thank you Maguy for letting us leave our luggage till late in the evening.
Maguy ist a very friendly and helpful host. Everything was fine and easy to handle with her. She prepared a nice french breakfast every morning. The flat was clean and there was no problem in sharing the bathroom with two other guests. We also liked the location around the flat with nice restaurants and cafes. There is a Metro station close to the flat (5 minutes to walk). All in all we really enjoyed our trip to Paris and we can highly recommend Maguy as a host!
O quarto é ótimo, a localização é muito boa e a hospitalidade de Maguy é excelente. Nos ajudou bastante!
Beautiful and very clean room, also a nice and clean bathroom and kitchen. Good breakfast. Located centrally, only a few minutes to a metro station. Open-minded and friendly host. Couldn't have been better!
I really enjoyed staying with Maguy; she was welcoming and friendly. Her place is immaculately clean and the room extremely comfortable. It's very quiet too, for a relaxing respite from any Paris noise. As a bonus, the Bistro Paul Bert is around the corner (as is their more casual place le 6 Paul Bert). I ate at both and they were among the best lunches and suppers I've ever had!! The 11ieme is definitely worth prowling around, more neighborhood than touristy, which I like. In the morning I went to a market and bought excellent cheese and fruit. There is a very nice wine store nearby as well, with many interesting moderately priced wines. I would go back in an instant; in fact, I'm planning another trip for the not too distant future, and I can certainly recommend Maguy's place!
Perfect place, graet host
Maguy's place was very clean and nice! The host was very polite and provided breakfast for us. It was in the perfect location to catch the Metro and Bus. The neighborhood was nice. We even found a bakery nearby that we went to each night on our way back from visiting the sights.
Perfect location in Paris. Great host and very welcoming! Quiet and clean. Great french breakfast ;-)
J'ai passé un excellent séjour chez Maguy, qui est très sympathique et serviable. Tout correspond aux photos publiées : chambre spacieuse, lumineuse et calme (ne donne pas sur la rue), literie confortable, appartement bien décoré et en excellent état, Internet performant, situation à deux pas du métro. Et la cerise sur la gâteau : baguette fraiche tous les matins au petit-déjeuner ! Vivement recommandé !
Jolie chambre très calme et très propre avec petit déjeuner complet Maguy est une hôte serviable et discrète Je reviendrais
thanks maguy for the wonderful stay
très agréable séjour dans cette jolie chambre calme belle déco cuisine et salle de bains également être réveillée par le chant des oiseaux est un luxe rare à Paris accueil sympathique e
I had an amazing time staying at Maguy's. She is a great host, really friendly and ready to help. The only thing, the noisy neighbours upstairs.
We've spend a weekend in Paris at Maguy's place and I would like to recommend this great host and her nice appartment to everyone. She was very kind and helpful, she knows """"her"""" city very well so you can get very handy tips for visiting the city, and the breakfast was a very pleasant way to start the day, The appartment itself is very clean, a warm and cosy oasis in a quiet neighbourhood, close to a few metro stations (only 2 minutes walking), so ideal for exploring the city during daytime and returning to a nice bed in the evening. There are also afew shops, markets and restaurants close to the appointment, so you can find everything you would ever need in the surrounding area. When returning to Paris, I would certainly check if the room is available, I enjoyed staying at Maguy's and if possible we will come over next time again. A big plus, thank you Maguy !"

We didn't have any problems with the place, but he made it clear that we could find him at the end of the corridor if anything came up. It was also a great location, I highly recommend it.
A really great and sunny place to stay in the center of Paris! It is clean, spacious and very comfortable, offering everything you need, great style included :) Even though the building is located in a busy area with a metro station right in front of its door, the appartement itself is very quiet. We loved the vibrant neighborhood with all its asian stores, restaurants and two great markets. Mathieu and his family are very lovely and helpful. They are always close in case you need something. We would definitely stay there again! Merci Mathieu!
Matthieu and his family were very welcoming and helpful during our stay and made sure we had a comfortable and enjoyable time. The apartment was spacious for the three of us that stayed, it had everything we needed. Light, clean, comfortable and easy to access. The metro station is literally opposite the apartment, so it meant fast and easy access to the rest of Paris. There are lots of shops and bars nearby also. Thanks to Matthieu and his family, I'm sure we'll be back to visit!
This apartment was perfect, and just as good as it looks! Matthieus hospitality was big and he helped us with all we needed. He gave us a list with suggestions of good restaurants in the area which helped us a lot. The apartment was in perfect condition when we arrived. The kitchen and the bathroom had all we needed and it was easy to keep them in good shape. We where two adults and two children in the apartment and it worked fine with the bed and the sofa beds. Beleville is quite close to the city and the metro station is just outside the door from the house. We can recommend this apartment to all of you.
Appartement très propre, lumineux, fonctionnel et grand, quartier très sympa, merci à Matthieu pour sa gentillesse, sont écoute et sa disponibilité, je recommande vraiment cette hôte et sont appartement
Merci Matthieu et Marjorie pour votre accueil, et votre disponibilité.Ce fut un plaisir """"d'essuyer les plâtres"""" et si l'appart' est dispo lors d'un autre séjour à Paris c'est avec joie que nous viendrons y poser à nouveau nos valises.Proximité du Metro, des commerces,et tranquilité la nuit sont des atouts non négligeables. L'agencement très bien pensé nous a permis de passer un super séjour avec nos 3 filles. A une prochaine fois, Lionel."

Great little place. Cozy and comfortable and very quiet. Close to the Notre Dame and the metro. Huben was great at returning my emails promptly. When I go back to Paris I would definitely consider staying here again!
This apartment was perfect. Excellent communication with Huben made arrival very easy. The apartment was clean and stocked with everything one may need while away from home and excellent internet service. Best of all was the location: a block away from a hub metro station; an enjoyable 1 mile walk to the Louvre where you can enjoy the tourist sites, but then come back to a more residential feeling neighborhood with a quiet courtyard for a good nights sleep. Highly recommend.
Appartement très agréable et très propre! Je le recommande!
The reservation was canceled 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Thanks it was a perfect apartment for our stay.
Lovely little cosy flat in a great location - Huben was available to help us find the place and let us store our luggage so we could enjoy the rest of the afternoon - definitely recommended!
Our first airbnb experience, and we will use them again, everything was perfect. Two kids under 9 and two adults, perfect size. We loved having a place to crash after days of walking. Never needed to take metro, could walk to everything. Huben was lovely, great cd selection!
Great apartment - pictures as shown. Fantastic location and excellent communication from host.
Very nice little apartment, very centrally located near Le Marais. The place itself is very quiet. Huben is a superb host, always very responsive and nice.
What a great location. From Gare du Nord it's a short taxi ride or (depending on bags) a trip on the 5 line to the Bastille on the Metro. The bathroom and toilet are a bit tight but a small price to pay for being in Paris. Huben himself was there to meet us and was extremely helpful and very welcoming (the perfect host). My family had a wonderful time. What a spectacular city. Don't miss the markets on Boulevarde Richard-Lenoir"

A good place to stay and within easy accessible distance to important locations. The apartment is small, cosy and you'll find everything you need including a much required washing machine. Andrzej is helpful and polite. A Recommended place!
Nice and well furnished apt near the metro Pl. de Clichy. There is everything you need, little but trendy bathroom, very good kitchen even with vacuum aleaner or washer. (Only little issues with wifi, there was a reciever, but i have not managed to catch it, my smartphone literally has not seen it( The owner is very nice and polite man. Highly recommended.
Han sido unos dias inolvidables. La estancia en casa de Andre ha sido estupenda. Nos recibió muy amable y el apartamento era perfecto. Pequeño y acogedor pero con todo lo que te hace falta!! Recomendable 100% Gracias Andre!!!
Ci siamo trovati benissimo. Pulizia e funzionalità sono ottime. Andrè è una persona molto gentile, ci ha fatto trovare in frigo acqua e latte a volontà ed in più una piacevole tavoletta di cioccolato. L'appartamento è l'ideale per due persone,il bagno è piccolo ma nuovo, pulito con una bella doccia. La via è piena di negozi di alimentari e take away. Appartamento molto sinlezioso in un condominio pulito e tranquillo. Metrò, bus e taxi sono a portata di mano. Ringraziamo Andre per la sua cortesia ed ospitalità
Andrzej est très arrangeant et son accueil est tout simplement parfait ! Nous y avons séjourné à deux reprises et à chaque fois c'est un pur plaisir ! Merci encore !
This is the perfect place to hideaway and be in the middle of everything at the same time. Great for 1 or 2 people. Andrzej was a thoughtful and considerate host by having small snacks available, milk, butter in the fridge, good bathroom shower gel or plain soap is you prefer. May seem like small things but it is the small things that make a difference when traveling and needing to feel at home as quickly as possible. The Place de Clichy neighborhood is probably my favorite in all of Paris and you walk in to the heart of it with the metro just around the corner and all of the conveniences, boulangers, restaurants (recommend Bistro des Dames right down the street) groceries, cafes and bars just outside your door. But even with all of the life happening outside, you are tucked away within a courtyard which makes it perfect for absolutely silent days and nights if you just want to chill. I would definitely stay here again! Perfect!
Andre is very considerate and helpful. The apartment is lovely and charming. Close to Metro and many restaurants. Bathroom is tiny but very new , modern and comfortable. Thank you Andre
L'appartement d'Andrzej est très agréable, un vrai petit cocon, la déco est parfaite et l'accueil superbe ! Merci Andrzej ! Monya
Nous y sommes allés 2 fois donc pas besoin de plus de commentaire... Andrezj est un hôte charmant!"

The flat is very secure, since you need two (2) door codes + the key to the flat to access the unit. Cozy and comfortable, clean. Except for a slight miscommunication (which was solved by an Airbnb representative), everything's been great with this flat. Yes, I will stay again in this flat. Thank you Cathy! Tip: On my way back to the CDG Airport, I just used the Ledru-Rolli station (Line 8) and got off at Opera station. Walk a few meters towards Rue Scribe, and the Roissy buses are waiting there which will pass at all terminals. Fare is 10.50 Euro. Big savings for those travelling alone, as compared to taking the shuttle or taxi which will be about 35 Euros already.
The appartement is very clean, cosy and good located. Cathy is a great host and was very willing to make us feel comfortable in Paris. We are looking forward to our next visit. Thank you Cathy!
This flat is perfect for a couple looking to see a non-touristy area of Paris. Although it is in the 11th, which we loved, it still has access to major metro lines to get into the heart of the city. Additionally, there was sufficient space and it was clean. We had a bit of a mix-up getting the keys, but Cathy took care of it in a reasonable amount of time. She was also good communicating with us before our arrival and during our stay.
This apartament was wonderful! We love to be there. There´s a great location, near to two metro station, and the neighborhood it´s amazing. There´s a lot of very nice pubs and restaurant. The apartament it´s big enough for 2 people, the sofa-bed it´s very comfortable and the other stuff working very well. We did not met Cathy, because she was out of Paris. But she asked her friend to do a check in and he was very nice and sweet. He help us to carry our luggage up stairs and explain everything that we need and also he spoke Portuguese! :) For sure I would recommend this apartament for everybody is looking for a great place to be in Paris! Thanks a lot Cathy! We appreciate our stay!!
Perfect petite apartment for a young couple, with a very central location when travelling from Bastille metro station. The apartment was clean, tidy and fully equipped. The bed was comfortable however the pillows were a little bit troubling, I would suggest bringing your own pillows anywhere you travel not just here, if you can fit them in your luggage. Cathy was very helpful and we would recommend this apartment to any of our friends and family, and would even return ourselves. Lots of lovely restaurants nearby we particularly liked """"Le Pause Cafe"""" which is seconds away from the house. There is a lot of stairs to get up and down to the apartment so be wary if you have a lot of luggage or you are elderly.
The little appartment is perfectly located in a neighbourhood with nice cafés and beautiful shops. The next metro station is near and easy to find. Thank you Cathy.
Everything was perfect: nice street, quiet courtyard, wonderful stairs, fantastic flat. Also I want to say about responsive Cathy (She was so nice and helpful even when we closed the keys inside the apartment at the last day, forgetting there is a bag with things). We had a unforgettable romantic days here. Thanks a lot!
Cathy's place is fantastic! The neighborhood is trendy, proximal to city action, safe, secure and very cozy. Working with Cathy was so easy, even though I didn't have a phone - she was incredibly accommodating and helpful. She practically bent over backwards to be sure that everything went smoothly. The flat itself was very clean and well equipped; I was sick the first couple of days on my trip and was grateful for the opportunity to make my own tea on command and for the extra blankets readily available. I also loved having laundry so accessible and was happy to have access to a blow-dryer when I wanted it. Thank you Cathy for helping to make my first trip to Paris so amazing!
We had a great time at this studio! It is not big, but everything you need is there. We also really liked the location; the street itself has some good restaurants and Le Marais is not far away either. As multiple other reviewers mentioned, the sofa-bed is surprisingly comfortable. Would book this again!
Cathy's studio was fantastic- all one needs for a weekend getaway. It's in the heart of Bastille and walking distance from all the bars and restaurants. It was clean and Cathy was very practical - left all instructions in the studio including building security code, wifi code, etc. We enjoyed our short stay there. Thank you Best regards Elvina and Clarence
Espectacular. El departamento muy lindo, limpio y completo. La ubicacion buena. Cathy muy simple, expeditiva y buena persona.
The reservation was canceled 220 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Cathy is nice. She try her best to help us to solve the problem.
Found the aperement absolutely beautiful The at metro stop absolutely rude they told be """"no tourist """" But Apperemt was really great heap off space clean Was kind off Close to ever thing Great food shop down stars Just wish the French would be more welcomeing
Cathy was an excellent host and the apartment was a cute and clean as on the pictures. We had someone welcoming us, and making sure we settle in well. I can definitely recommend the apartment to anyone looking for a nice, good located apartment in Paris!
Cathy was extremely helpful and the apartment was perfect for a long weekend! Would strongly recommend
The apartment was exactly as pictured and in an amazing central Marais location. Cathy was very nice and really tried to make sure that everything was taken care of.
The apartment was very nice and in a very good location in the heart of the Marais near most sites. Cathy was helpful but unobstrusive- which is what I wanted. When I had questions she responded promptly. Would stay here again!
Cathy was a fantastic host! The place was in the best location...walking distance to fantastic food, museums, shopping... She was very easy to contact. She was flexible on the timing of giving us the keys and picking them back up. The apartment was perfect for a lovely stay in Paris!
Cathy sera une hôte agréable qui vous conseillera selon vos envies, son appartement est idéalement situé, vous voilà au cœur de Paris. Bienvenue
Cathy works as a real estate agent.She knows her city very well and she will always be very pleased to make you discover Paris.She's a nice and reliable person.I recommend!
Cathy is exceptionally friendly ! The apartment is fantastic and located in the most charming district of Paris : Le Marais."

The house is very spacious and comfortable. its suitable for young traveller with least luggage as you need to climb up the stairs to reach the house.
What a superb location and leaning-out-of-the-window-watching-the -Parisians-go-by view. 3 restaurants and a cafe downstairs. We did no cooking in the apartment ! 5 minutes from the Louvre. Up 5 flights of stairs but they were shallow and beautiful. No steeper than those in the pyramid. The apartment lived up to its description and pictures and Virginie left us each a little gift on our towels. Would hope to return.
What can I say about this little gem of an apartment. First of all there is the location. It has some of Paris' most iconic sights all within very short walking distances. It has a plethora of bars, restaurants and plenty of shopping right on the doorstep (Les Halles Shopping Center which is currently being refurbished but is set to be and amazing place once finished). We ate in the restaurant right below the apartment and the food was delicious. If you are flying into Paris CDG it is very easy to get to by public transport. Straight down on the RER line B to Chatlet les Halles and it's a five minute walk if you are not tempted by the shops, restaurants or a cheeky aperitif. It is Paris after all. :-) The apartment itself is a fab apartment. It's on the fourth floor and has a lovely city view out of the window with all of the hustle and bustle of Paris below. Shut the windows and it's complete silence. Take your pick. I personally love to have the window open and have the sounds of the city drift into the apartment. Finally for the host Virgine. She could not have been more pleasant and accommodating. She was in regular contact before we arrived and answered all our queries. When we arrived, we received a very warm welcome and she gave us the benefit of her local knowledge of where to shop, where the local supermarkets were, what time they opened till, which are the best restaurants, and so on. All in all I wish I owned this little gem so that I could go back and visit as often as I wanted. There's a reason it's listed so highly on airbnb. Simply put It's quintessential Parisian living.
This is a really nice apartment in a great location. We were able to walk to a lot of locations and the metro station is close. Good cafe right down stairs! I would definitely recommend this property.
We have just returned from an excellent stay at Virginie's apartment. The apartment is really well furnished with everything we needed, and felt like a home away from home. The location is perfect - about 10 minutes walking from the Seine and the Louvre is close by. There are also a supermarket and cafe just downstairs! We drove to Paris, and there was underground parking just 5 minutes from the apartment. No fault at all with this apartment, if you are going to Paris, stay here!
We had a lovely stay in Virginie's two bedroom apartment. It was so centrally located we were able to walk everywhere and see everything. There were wonderful cafés and stores right outside our door. Our hostess thoughtfully provided everything we needed to be comfortable including cleaning and """"starter"""" kitchen supplies so we didn't have to rush to the store. The four flights up might be a drawback to some ( an elevator is coming!) but we were up to the challenge and I didn't gain a pound. The weather was lovely and we enjoyed 3 free days of public transportation because of a pollution alert that didn't bother us at all. It was our first Air BnB rental experience but it won't be our last.
We really enjoyed our stay at this great Parisian apartment, great location.
We have very good memories of this place, we did stay for 4 nights in this apartment and we wish we could stay much longer. This place is situated in a very centralized area of Paris and it's close to the Louvre museum and to the Louvre de Rivoli station. The 4 of us like did have a good time in this place and we do like it very much. Thank you for letting us stay and rent this beautiful place, and for sure we will comeback. Thanks Virginia
Marvelous flat in a first class location three minutes from Louvre. Splendid restaurants nearby particularly Victoires and a Sardinian restaurant plus a lovely baker. Go from the square up Rue de Louvre towards Gard du Nord first left. Very near. It only takes three minutes to get to the train which takes you to Charles De Gaulle airport. The station is Chatelet des Halles and the journey lasts from 20 to 35 minutes according to whether you get the fast or slow train to the airport. all of this could be put in a guide book by Virginie."

We stayed very well in the cosy-chic studio and for five days it seemed to be a true Parisian. The studio is very nice, clean, practical and with all the comforts and a good price. The metro is near (100 mt). The backery, the pharmacy and the supermarket are all in 100/200mt. Very pratic. People traveling with family knows what I mean. For a family....the best solution. A nice experience that I'll do again in the future....next time I'll go to Paris. Emma è una persona estremamente cortese e gentile. Siamo stati molto bene nel cosy-chic studio e per cinque giorni ci è sembrato di essere dei veri parigino. Lo studio è molto bello, pulito, pratico e con tutti i comforts e con un buon prezzo. La metro è vicine (100mt). Il fornaio, la farmacia ed il supermarket sono tutti entro 100/200mt. Molto pratico. Chi viaggia con la familia sa quello che vuol dire. Per una familia....la soluzione miliore. Una bella esperienza che farò ancora in futuro...la prossima volta che andrò a Parigi.
Le studio était super, très propre, bien équipé, aménagé avec beaucoup de goût et surtout très facile à trouver! La communication avec Emma était parfaite également; soit UN REVE:)! Merci beaucoup Emma, à bientôt!
The house is perfect!
the appartement was very convenient and comfortable and the price was reasonable for paris.
Emma went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Was able to offer advice on the area, which was great. The area was perfect local shops and people but close to the metro for easy access everywhere. The house was wonderful, has everything you need and room for plenty of people. We were there over Christmas and we felt at home and in luxury at the same time. Thank you emma, we love our stay.
Perfekter Ausgangspunkt für einen Parisaufenthalt, wenn man es familiär und persönlich mag. Emma ist super nett und hilfsbereit. Saubere und total gemütliche Unterkunft, ein Kleinod inmitten einer Metropole! Perfekt, dass es eine Garage gibt. Die Erreichbarkeit der Rue de Montreuil ausgehend vom Rheinland ist super angenehm und ideal ohne wilde Verkehrsknäuel. Im Viertel gibts alles, was man braucht, ob Supermarkt, Wochenmarkt oder Restaurants verschiedenster Art! Super Verkehrsanbindung, denn die Metro ist 2 min zu Fuß entfernt. Es war einfach toll! Ganz lieben Dank Emma! Und hoffentlich auf bald.
Emma and Boris are wonderful hosts, really nice people! The apartment is really nice, clean, very dodgy space for several people, has everything you need to be nice with a group of people. It is really well located, we had a great stay at this apartment, worth choose it and enjoy Paris knowing that you accounts with so comfortable like this apartment for you and your group of family or friends.
L'appartamento di Emma non solo è bello da vedere perchè rispecchia il classico appartamento moderno parigino ma è anche molto funzionale (ha tutte le comodità che una casa deve avere). La posizione è ottimale perchè vicino alla metro , vicino al marais (il quartiere più bello di Parigi)ed è situato in un quartiere ricco di negozi ristoranti super market ecc.Emma è molto ospitale ma soprattutto gentile(mi ha rispedito una cosa che avevo lasciato nella sua casa senza nessun problema). Consiglio a tutti questa scelta per immergersi nella vita vera parigina.
Very convenient apartment, at a great location, less than a minute walk to the metro station. The Bastille (with its Sunday Market) and place de Vosges within walking distance. Supermarkets and Boulangeries as well. Safe neighborhood. Very clean, up-kept, good mattresses and well-equipped kitchen. Definitely enough space for a group of ten! The pictures of the apartment are accurate. The apartment is on the second floor and it should be noted that second flight of stairs to the apartment are very steep, probably something to consider with a group with young children or elderly. Additionally, the stairs inside the triplex (two flight of stairs) have no banister. Since in our group we had no young children this was not a problem. Thank you EMMA for everything!
Stayed at this excellent apartment in a wonderful Paris neighborhood with two colleagues on a business trip. Numerous excellent cafes and restaurants are around the area, and it is nicely off the tourist track, while being close enough to get to the big Paris sites after a short walk or metro ride. Emma and her husband were very welcoming and helpful, and the apartment is both super functional and kinda cool. Highly recommended.
Highly recommend the apartment. The location is excellent and very close to a metro entrance + surrounded by shops near the market + plenty of excellent bars and restaurants in surrounding streets. The apartment was located in a quiet secure courtyard well separated from the noise of the street. Inside it was well appointed and comfortable for our group of 7. The hosts were friendly + helpful and accommodating, even managing to squeeze our large car into the small garage.
Living in Paris in this apartment for almost a week, was one of my best holiday experiences. The apartment is 1 minute far away from metro station, and it is in a lovely part of Paris which is full of restaurants and green parks. However the neighborhood is a bit crowded and full of energy, the windows are looking to an inner court which is very silent all the time. I highly recommend this place for families, it is huge and very cosy. Emma was helpful and friendly all the time. She was waiting for us in the apartment, gave us the keys, and helped us whenever we had some problems. All in all it is a perfect place for a group of people to spend their holiday in Paris.
Super appartement convivial et très bien équipé à 2 pas du métro et a quelques minutes du quartier très animé de Bastille bref un emplacement idéal pour partir à la découverte de Paris, faire les boutiques et sortir je le recommande vivement Isabelle
Huge Parisian apartment, wonderful interior design, perfect to have great vacation in Paris with friends or/and family. Central Paris and near metro station, great to visit Paris. Karine
An adorable HUGE apartment in a great location. Wonderful for a family to use when in Paris - lots of space, and very comfortable!! Has a lovely kitchen, too! :)"

Thank you for a good stay. The location of the apartment is excellent and the apartment was exactly what I needed for a quick and comfortable stay in Paris. Philippe was very helpful.
Philippe's flat is great. Very clean, new and charmant. It's in the heart of Paris, in the lovely (email hidden)ly neighborhood crowded with nice cafés, restaurants, great shops and museums. Philippe was very kind, the appartment has a coffee and a tea machine available, we enjoyed having breakfast at home in the morning. We are looking forward to go back to Paris!
Had a great stay at Philippe's apartment! It was clean, and perfect for our long weekend stay. The location was perfect. Within walking distance to anything you need. We loved the cafe downstairs! I would definitely recommend staying in this apartment!
We were graciously welcomed by Philippe and enjoyed our visit in his cozy flat. He was very hospitable and attentive. We enjoyed the area, it's restaurants & convenience to the metro. We would recommend this unit to others.
This is a perfect spot to stay while in Paris. It's in a cool neighborhood (the Marais), lots of great shopping, cafe's, restaurants, museums, etc.. Perfect Paris locale. The building is old and charming, and the bathroom is modern and clean. Phillipe was very kind and helpful with recommending local spots. I also had to catch a last minute train, and he happily gave me a lift to the station along with an extra train ticket he happen to have. Thanks, Phillipe! I definitely recommend.
We had a lovely time in Philippe's cute little Paris apartment! It is situated in a sweet neighborhood within comfortable walking distance to the tube and major sights like Notre Dame and the Louvre. It felt that we were """"living"""" in Paris instead of just being a tourist. The beds were comfortable and the WiFi was good. Philippe was a wonderful host! He helped us find the apartment when we got lost, helped us drag our 3 very large suitcases up 4 flights of stairs and even called a taxi for our departure since I couldn't pronounce the street names. The shower and toilet were a bit small and tricky to manage, but nothing too difficult. Overall we had a fabulous time and I would highly recommend staying here to anyone in the future!
This was my first time using airbnb and what a great experience. The apartment was just as it was presented on the site and exactly what I was looking for. The host was very helpful,the appartment was clean, and we slept like babes each night with the window open on our top floor abode. the apartment was just a 10 minute walk away from Notre Dame. I was able to make breakfast each morning on our petite stove top. Thank you again. We would definitely stay again.
Phillipe, Thanks so much for the lovely stay. The Marais location was prefect and the apartment was exactly what we needed for a quick and comfortable stay in Paris. I especially loved the loft view of rooftops! Thanks again, Carolyn
Anne fell in love with Philippe's apartment and now wants to move to Paris and live in it! It's very large and has big windows with lots of light. It's also in a great location. Less than 10 minutes walk to the Censier Daubenton station on the #7 Metro line which goes right to the Louvre. About a 15 minute walk to the RER B line which goes directly to the Gare du Nord (Railroad station) and all the way to CDG airport. And best of all, it's a 5 minute walk to the wonderful Rue Mouffetard, one of the oldest streets in Paris, with a bustling, permanent street market. If you love food, you'll love Rue Mouffetard! Philippe gave us great directions on the best way to get to and from his apartment. He met us there with two sets of keys, as requested, and communication with him was easy. We'll definitely be contacting him again on our next trip to Paris.

We went to Paris to watch our son in the Marathon and had a sunny weekend in this wonderfully light and artfully decorated apartment. We felt wonderfully at home and comfortable among the artworks and velvet and slept deeply on the excellent beds. A great location and a wonderful space from which to venture forth and explore the cultural richness fo Paris.
Philippe was very attentive and helpful! And the location of the apartment is excellent! Thanks very much for everything!
Unser verlängertes Paris-Wochenende war einfach großartig! Die Wohnung von Philippe ist vollkommen ausreichend für 2, Bad und Küche sind sehr gut ausgestattet, WLAN war hilfreich für die Routenplanung. Man ist super angebunden: zu den U-Bahn Stationen Falguière und Duroc ist es nicht sehr weit (ca. 150m / 500m), ca. 5 Stationen nach Notre Dame. Alles weitere auch nicht weit entfernt. Ein Supermarkt, Restaurants und Kneipen sind um die Ecke. Trotzdem ist es in der Straße sehr ruhig, nur die Metro hört man manchmal (wenn man drauf achtet - die letzte fährt um 0:30 Uhr). Einziges Manko: Die Schlafcouch, die zwar seeehr bequem ist, quietscht sehr laut bei jeder Bewegung. Ein bisschen Öl könnte hier helfen (Tipp an den Besitzer ;-) ). Ansonsten: Philippe ist sehr nett und zuvorkommend, hat viele Tipps gegeben und auch gedruckt hinterlassen. Gerne wieder!
GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY! Philippe was a great host. Met us at apt despite our late arrival in the evening and even accommodated us with late checkout given our evening train departure. Apartment location was quite convenient with two different metro lines both within 50-100 meters of apartment. Neighborhood is off the typically trodden tourist itinerary which made it all the more interesting with more local flavor to discover. Philippe also gave some good recommendations for restaurants in the area, one of which we tried, Les Bombis - great meal. Apartment itself was ground floor just off interior courtyard of building. Very quiet and had everything we needed for our weekend visit to Paris. Was a very good value for money given size...especially when compared to Paris hotel rooms. We stayed there as a family of 3 with our 4yr old son sleeping on the fold-out couch. Only minor flaws were that the fold-out couch wasn't particularly comfortable (but then again, what sleeper sofa is?) and the boiler (hot water heater) turns on frequently and is not very quiet. But, as I said, those were very minor things. Overall a nice experience. If you are there on a Sunday, be sure to check out vegetable market on Rue d'Aligre (a short walk away). It was fabulous...one of the better ones I've seen in Paris.
L'appartement est coquet et charmant. Il est bien placé dans un quartier calme et agréable. Il contient les équipements nécessaires pour passer un bon séjour. La literie est propre et agréable. Nous y avons passé un excellent moment. Notre hôte nous a conseillé un marché pittoresque à proximité"

The flat was modern, well-maintained, and spotlessly clean. Due to our late arrival, Jean-Francois was unable to meet us, but provided clear instructions on how to reach the flat and to access the keys via a lockbox. The location was perfect and steps away from the numerous shops and cafe on Rue Montorgueil. Jean-Francois also allowed us to stay in the flat until 3pm on our day of departure which was much appreciated. The one recommendation would be to provide fresh soap and shampoo for new arrivals (none was provided- but we had our own). Overall, a very pleasant experience.
Excellent apartment, at the best point of the city.
Amazing apt & an incredibly ideal location – definitely much better than a hotel stay. It was my first time in Paris & this apt was the perfect spot to venture around tourist and local sites. The apt itself was more than enough space for me & my boyfriend. Jean-Francois was very helpful & friendly – even flexible with our check-in time. He gave us directions from CDG & was responsive with any of our questions. I will definitely recommend to any friends heading to Paris.
A true gem. I stayed in this apartment for 6 days in Feb/March 2014 with my husband. This apartment has everything you need and is clean and well kept. The queen bed is very comfortable and the bathroom was fantastic (good water pressure). I was also looking for something modern. The location is unbeatable - we walked everywhere and rarely took the metro even though there were plenty of metro stations nearby. The street itself is filled with bakeries, markets, cafes, restaurants and pharmacies so we were able to get anything we needed just a few steps from the apartment. Jean-François was a pleasure to work with. He was responsive and flexible with our check-in and check-out times. Everything was seamless. We did experience some sporadic smoke smell in our bedroom. The smell was from workers doing construction on one of the lower apartments (temporary issue) and we were able to air it out with help from Jean-François. This is now my go to apartment rental in Paris.
The flat was super nice and clean. It was also perfectly located, in the center of Paris and in a very charming street with shops and restaurants. The host was very helpful and available for us when we had questions. I will definitely try to book it again next time I am in Paris. Highly recommended !!!
We loved this beautiful and comfortable apartment. The location was amazing as Rue Montorgueil was wonderful and we did not really need to use public transport as it was so central. The apartment was stylish, bright and well equipped with really comfortable beds. I cannot praise our host highly enough; he was incredibly kind and helpful which was hugely appreciated. I would always seek to stay in one of his apartments should we revisit Paris. A delightful stay!
Lovely apartment in superb location, nicely furnished with super bathroom and kitchen that is small but well able to manage cooking dinners for our family of 4. Apartment is located in rear courtyard and therefore extremely quiet, but right outside main entrance is lively Rue Montorgeuil. Even sister-in-law who lives in Paris (but very tight for space for visitors) stressed what a great location our apartment was in. Cafes, supermarket, boulangerie, restaurants all right on door step. Metro station Sentier at 1 minutes walking distance, Reaumur & Sebastopol less than 5 minutes walk. We never met host but felt very well looked after via very detailed instructions on finding apartment and phone calls when we required help. Highly recommended. Katrina, February 2014 (family of 4)
Just checked out of Jean-Francois' apartment - great experience. Not only was the apartment just as nice in person as it was online, Jean-Francois couldn't have been a better host. He provided precise directions, a detailed info packet and great recommendations that anticipated our every need - all very much appreciated. We highly recommend this apartment.
Great location, very lively and trendy area , rue montorgueil probably one of the best spot in Paris! The appartment is cosy and very comfortable, and jean francois was very careful about each details, definitely a good host. Thank you
Great apartment in a fantastic, easy to get to location. Very helpful host, highly recommended. Thanks for a wonderful time in Paris Jean François!
We had a great stay in the apartment. Everything was great and very easy to work with Jean-François. We are still thinking about the great pillows on the bed! The apartment is in a great location and was the perfect place to stay for our trip.
Very nice apartment in a nice location. While we did not meet Jean-Francois, we corresponded a number of times during our stay -- always received a prompt response. Once booked the absolute BEST directions you could imagine on getting to and getting into the apartment!!! Very much appreciated. Only one metro stop from Gare du Nord. Very convenient. Great locations with many cafes within a block of the apartment. Would definitely recommend.
We stayed here for 5 days and everything was fabulous! The apartment is perfect. Very clean and with all the necessary amenities. Location is a major plus of this apartment as well. It is located on a quaint street full of restaurants, markets, and energy! Short walk to metro and the ever-popular marais. Would definitely stay here again!
Jean-François was a great host. Very flexible, helpful and his apartment was the best place ever! Wo loved it! It was a great trip. Thanks to Jean-François!
Très bel appartement.Confortable et Bien équipé ,la décoration récente est soignée et de très bon gout. Au calme et très bien situé pour un séjour découverte de Paris. Je recommande vivement ce logement. L organisation du séjour est parfaite,Jean -François est très disponible et à l'écoute. Merci beaucoup Nous reviendrons! Alexandrine
Appartment was perfect! Cozy, modern in a very typical french building with Its courtyard. The location is amazing. The street is so lively!! Bakeries, butchers, fruits&veg as if you had a market at opening the door. And of course, coffees and terraces. Not to mention that underground is only 5min away... Will be back for sure!!!!
Stunning apartment - so cool! So cool in fact, that I struggled to get my daughter out of it to go and see Paris. Her favourite thing about the city was 'chillin' in the apartment'! Brilliant location - it's at the back of a quiet courtyard on a pedestrianized street - so no traffic noise at all. The street itself is buzzy and lively, loads of cafes and bars, great bakery - oldest in Paris, fromagerie, fruit shops etc. Walking distance to the Louvre and 3 metro stops very close. The bed and sofa bed are really good quality - very comfortable. Fantastic shower too - a lot of thought has gone into this apartment and it shows. All communications and directions very clear too. this was the first time we have used Airbnb and we are so impressed. Will definitely be back!
Just perfect!
JF's apartment was really lovely and I had a great stay. He was brilliant at communicating and making sure I had everything I needed. Really hope to be back soon!
I have been knowing Jean-François for more than 20 years and I have been able several time to be a witness of his international mindset and his passion for Paris. He’s happy and proud to welcome people from all over the world in his sweet home which has been specifically renovated to provide comfort and modern design. Top of it Jean-François is always reliable and professional. Having Jean-François as host is a guarantee of peaceful and successful vacations. Best regards Denis
I thought that I was knowing Paris quite well, but I have been deliciously surprised by the top quality and location of the Montorgeuil apartment proposed by Jean-Francois. Jean-Francois is a nice person alike what he offers : passionated, rigorous, taking care of the tiny details that will make your stay a unique experience in Paris. You will appreciate his international background (acquired in a former life with MultiNational corporations), his honest and straightforward contact. Last but not least, he is so proud to share his Paris expertise and will often have a """"bon plan"""" (for instance Wine tasting) for you. What else ?
Jean-François is very generous and pays attention to everything he does. He is a lover of Paris and of French wine. The renovation of his apartment reflects that. He is always glad and proud to welcome tourists and to communicate his passion for Paris. He knows all the ins and outs about his magic city and could spend hours talking about his passion for Paris. Jean-François is born in Paris and has always lived here. He has traveled a lot around the world. He knows the feeling about being away and this feeling has driven the way he has prepared his apartment for his clients. He is reliable and trustable. He will always be happy to help you at any time. For those who are wine connoisseur, Jean-François will be pleased to share with you everything he knows about French wine.
I have the highest recommendation for Jean-Francois. He is truly a very nice and professional. I wished to rent his lovely apartment and he always answered my messages very quickly. I had some trouble in coordinating my travel and he was very helpful and thinking """"out of the box"""" to find a solution that suited me fine. He also went out of his way to make arrangements for me and my family. He is a very polite and kind person. In the end we had to decline due to personal reasons and even then he was very understandning. All in all a very satisfying experince with a very kind person with a high level of service."

We arrived and were greeted in the most friendly of manners by Alain who showed us how everything worked and even supplied me and my friends with a bottle of red wine (which complemented our locally bought Cheese plate that evening). The apartment is in the most perfect location, everything felt so close and we were spoiled for choice when it came to cafes, bars, shops and restaurants. Jasmine flowers on the balcony and some exquisite furnishings, not to mention one of the best nights sleep I've had in ages! Without a doubt we will be back! Thank you so much for having us. Dan
A group of four of us stayed for four nights at Le Marais Romantic in April 2014 to celebrate my 50th birthday. The apartment is beautiful - exactly as shown in the photos on the site. It is perfectly situated right in the heart of Le Marais surrounded by lovely shops, cafés and restaurants. The Seine and the 'Batobus' stop, Ile de la Cite and Notre Dame are just short walk away. Dora and Alain were wonderful hosts. Communication prior to the visit was clear, helpful and welcoming. They welcomed us warmly when we arrived and showed us the apartment. Gifts of wine and fruit were kindly left out for us. There was helpful information in the apartment and Alain and Dora were contactable if we needed them. We had a wonderful time! The street outside the apartment can be noisy because it is so central but this is a small price to pay for the fantastic location and the beautiful apartment. I would love to go back and stay another time. Thank you Dora and Alain!
Our family of two adults and two kids (ages 3 and 6) stayed in Dora's unit for five nights. Dora and Alan were wonderful hosts, they were welcoming and extremely accommodating. The unit was exactly as depicted in the pictures: cosy, clean and charming. The location is fantastic, a very easy walk to wonderful museums, parks and shops.
Le Marais Romantic was absolutely wonderful! I stayed there with my partner and his mother, and there was plenty of room and privacy for all of us. It was really comfortable and clean, and just a really attractive little apartment in a perfect area, so very affordable for everything you get. The apartment is surrounded by lots of interesting bars and shops so there's plenty to do, and even though there's so much going on outside it's very peaceful and quiet inside. Dora and Alain were perfect hosts: very friendly and very happy to help where needed. We only stayed one night, but I think we'd all like to return and stay longer!
A beautiful apartment in such a beautiful area of Paris. Dora and Alain were amazing with recommendations on places to eat, visit and wander off to. Would stay again, apartment was cozy, comfortable and was lacking nothing. Loved it!!!
This was the most beautiful accommodation we have stayed in. We did not want to leave and will definately be back to stay on our next visit to Paris. The hosts were so friendly and kind and made us feel very welcome. The apartment is soundproof and has heating in all rooms so it is very warm. It is in perfect codition, and feels like a real French experience. The location is perfect, we felt very safe, and there are boutiques and restaurants right outside the door.
Both apartment and location were perfect. Only five block walk to Notre Dame and some great restaurants! We had a wonderful time and saved a lot of $$ vs. two hotel rooms. Will definitely stay again when we return to Paris.
Very nice apartment in gorgeous street. We had a wonderful time. Thank you Dora and Alain
We had a wonderful break in Paris staying at Dora & Alain's delightful 'Le Marais Romantic' apartment. Alain & Dora were perfect hosts. They helped us when we needed it and provided all the information we required about the apartment, Le Marais district and Paris generally. Le Marais Romantic is a perfect apartment, beautifully and loving decorated and located at the heart of Le Marais district which is within easy walking distance of most of central Paris tourist sights. The apartment is situated on Rue Vielle du Temple - ideal for local bars, bistros, cafes and shopping without the hustle and bustle of much of Paris. We would thoroughly recommend Le Marais Romantic for a short break in Paris. Many thanks again Dora & Alain.
Excellent! Dora and Alain provided us with all the information needed well in advance and were waiting to greet us to explain the finer details and hand over the keys. A wonderful apartment which was immaculate - I only wish we could have stayed longer!"

My daughter recently came back from Paris, and her and her boyfriend stayed at Jessicas flat.

Mariusz was an amazing host and I will certainly look him up again!! The location couldn't get any better!!
Good location, clean, convenient, comfortable. Small, simple and secure. Only criticism would be the shower which is not too powerful but other than that its fine and as advertised.
Really lovely experience, in the heart of Marais!
Charming little flat. Really clean. Beautiful view. Really pleasant host. Very understanding about our faux pas of being late for the check in. Once again, we are sorry. Highly recommended. Hopefully see you soon.
Small but serviceable apartment in the heart of the Marais. Can't beat the location and the high floor makes for a fantastic view. Mariusz was welcoming and very accommodating with my check-in time.
Good apartment in good place
Toute petite chambre perchée sous les toits très bien située et très calme. Attention, escalier raide ! Le ménage n'est pas parfait mais la literie est propre et l'accueil très sympatique.

Nous avons passé un excellent séjour à Paris dans cet appartement. Situé dans un quartier vivant, idéalement situé en plein centre, il est placé dans une rue très calme. L'appartement est très bien décoré, cosy, très confortable sur une belle cour arborée. Tout était très propre. Accueil très chaleureux, disponible pour notre arrivée. Nous avons vraiment apprécié ce lieu et cette rencontre, tout était parfait. Nous recommandons vivement cette adresse.
Excellent space, Martina was really nice and clear. here place is nice and she is an awesome lady. I would highly recommend her for anyone who is planning to stay in Paris!
L'appartement est juste exceptionnel pour Paris. Grand, agréable, bien équipé. Un très bel endroit avec un très bon accueil.
L'accueil de Martine fut parfait et chaleureux et j'ai eu le privilège de gouter des confitures extra !! , et la suite de la grande classe
Hôte très sympathique. Logement bien aménagé, spacieux, classe. Plein de petites attentions très agréables. Bref ... à rééditer ...
Very lovely, spacious room and comfy bed. Quiet neighborhood but great street 2 minutes away with little bars and restaurants perfect for dinner, drinks and brunch. Pretty close to metro, secure front door with code leading to courtyard. Martine was nice and polite. She has a very cute cat :)
Suite confortable et très douillette d'un goût plus que sûr. Idéalement situé (à trois minutes de marche du métro sentier) vous pourrez rejoindre toutes les destinations de votre choix. Martine est une hôtesse très disponible, dont la discrétion n'a d'égal que sa gentillesse. Adresse à retenir sans s'un doute.
Consiglio vivamente la casa di Martine . La stanza è qualcosa di davvero eccezionale e trovarsi in pieno centro a Parigi in una camera del genere è quel valore aggiunto alla vacanza. La casa sempre pulita, un'enorme ed accogliente cucina dove abbiamo condiviso simpatici momento con Martine e la sua amica ! Sono tornata pensando """"non potevo trovare posto migliore """" ( e tendenzialmente sono molto molto critica ) .

L'appartamento di Martine é davvero molto carino, in perfetto stile parigino! Situato a pochi metri dalla fermata della metro Sentier, la zona é ottima per visitare la città! Il quartiere é molto tranquillo e la casa e' dotata di tutti i comfort. Molto consigliata!!!
Amazing apartment in a very central location, right next to a subway station! Very safe area as we walked to the local eat outs in the area. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to visit paris and would recommend purchasing the subway tickets. If I return to Paris, this will be the place I will stay."

We're actually very disappointed about the house as there are many things that do not correspond to the reality: There are many steps to arrive and the room is very very small, the toilet is absolutely small (if you take a shower the water goes into the room most of the times)... but this can be accepted just for a few days. But the things we didn't like at all were: - In the email, they gave us a wrong name where to ring the bell.. when we arrived we didn't know what to do as we called several times the telephone number provided and nobody answer. At the end we tried to ring the most similar surname and we were lucky - there was no wifi in the room, even if we were given the id and password (we urgently needed wifi and we choose this apartment for that reason... now we see in the airbnb description that wifi is no longer available) - the most ridiculous thing was that there was a television with no cable and not even the antenna plug in the wall Yes, the apartment is cozy, with a really nice forniture and in a very good spot but we like to get what we pay for and we think that not giving proper informations and not answering at the telephone when you're waiting for someone, is a lack of respect.
David´s studio is just lovely and perfectly located in the heart of Marais - shops ( the new pop shop by Kenzo included), trendy cafes and cozy restaurants are just around the corner, literally. Perfect for a couple to stay up to one week. It is also very well decorated and the building is super clean, which is a plus. The only negative point was that both Internet and TV were not working - and no one contested us when we asked for the password. Still, I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends.

Super simple check-in and great communication with David. The apartment was in such a perfect location. I couldn't have asked for anything better! Great size for two people as well!
My partner and I stayed at David's studio for a few days in late July. When we arrived, despite making very clear plans about 'check-in', nobody answered the doorbell. Thankfully we had just sorted out a mobile phone as we had to call and message several times to get through to David/Victor. David arrived 15 mins later and was apologetic, but told us he had forgotten all about us coming. When David showed us into the studio he was friendly and we accepted his apology as he seemed sincere. However, we were again disappointed when we later opened the fridge (the contents of which we were told were for us) to find half a bottle of wine, half a bottle of juice (expired a month earlier) and a mouldy opened jar of preserves. The wifi service was frustrating as it was coming from David's apartment a few floors below and a signal was still very patchy and very slow even when we sat on the window ledge as David suggested we do. Being the middle of summer and several floors up in an old building, it got very hot. We knew there would not be air conditioning but a fan would have made a big difference to comfort. Despite the above, the studio is in a wonderful area of Paris and we loved the location. There is a lovely cafe right at the door downstairs, and we were able to walk to most of the sights of Paris.
Nice little appartment in le marais ! Enjoy !!
David was the perfect host. The studio is in a lovely neighborhood with plenty to do and easy access to metro stations. We would stay again in a heartbeat I highly recommend this airbnb. Merci David!
The Studio apt was small but cute and perfect and had nice access to wifi ( a bit spotty, but by the window worked fine). Didn't have any issues and had a wonderful stay in paris. it is located right above an amazing cafe and in the center of an amazing part of paris, i highly recommend this for a single person or couple. 4 flight walkup though!
Nice, clean and cosy flat! Perfect location and a great place to stay.
The apartment was very clean and amazing (email hidden) is tiny but big enough for a short stay. Unfortunately the wifi wasnt working which a bit annoying as we were working there aswell and were expecting wifi access. David was very accomadating with changing our check in time due to delays and being flexible ith check out time.
Location is great and David is very friendly host. Apartments are small but cosy and tidy. Highly recommended."

It is very well located close to the underground station Cardinal Lemoine. It is also quiet at night,clean and very safe. If there was anything to change I would add a small wardrobe to hang clothes if people were staying longer. I would recommend the boulangerie close by that makes great chaussons aux pommes and croissants for breakfast. Restaurants are better at the bottom of the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine and also not to forget the market rue Moufetard. We would stay again, Merci Nicolas et Santiago

My husband, daughter, and I recently stayed at """"Cosy"""" for a long weekend in Paris. The apartment was very nice and the St. Germain location was perfect. Thanks Nicolas for a wonderful stay!
NICOLAS MET US ONTIME AND SHOWED US AROUND THE APARTMENT. THE LOCATION IS EXCELLENT, IT IS SAFE AREA, AND WE REALLY ENJOYED OUR STAY.
Good apartment, excellent location, easy to access as its on ground floor, more spacious than a hotel room and clean and convenient as has everything necessary - from table to small kitchenette. Nicolas was easy to deal with, prompt replies and we had no problem checking in and checking out. Would stay here again!
The apt was exactly as described and the location perfect for getting to the Louvre, Tuileries, d'Orsay, etc.. We were able to walk to everyplace of interest. For us, the best features were that it was very quiet (ground floor), modernly furnished, modern bathroom and had a big comfortable bed (hard too find that in Paris). Working with Nicholas was very easy, he accommodated our schedule for key pickup and checkout. Definitely recommend this apt and Nicholas. Hope to visit again!
This is a wonderful apartment in a charming and convenient neighborhood. It is really as described. Nicolas was very accommodating and all went smoothly. I stayed there with my husband and 10 year old son and it was perfect. We would definitely return. Many thanks.
Even if i stayed at another apartment the stay was perfect. Nicolas is a great host, everything was perfect and the flat is amazing! And the location is great, in a quiet aera the subway. I'll definitively come back here !
i will write very honestly. first, the flat is not exactly like on the picture. the sofa is old and a bit dirty , and no sofa table which they just put a box with one wooden board... the flat is nice, good to live for one person. i like the most is all the sound system. but... when i check in, the flat was not clean.... dirty food in the frige. Nicolas sent somebody to clean after. he did came once when i could not connect the wifi. he helped for it. but there was one broken light in kitchen, he said he will come to fix it but never came in one month....the bed is also not exactly like on the picture either...one convinient is very close to Gare du nord. but i didnt like the aera....
Nicolas's flat was as promised. Modern, clean lines and the added bonus of being in a gorgeous old building on one of the nicest streets in st germain. I was met promptly, given keys and a tour of place and enjoyed a fabulous week in my very own home in Paris. Will definitely book again. Thanks heaps
Nicolas is a great host! The apartment is on the ground floor and very clean. We had a great time staying at Nicolas's apartment. Location is perfect to see everything in Paris - an easy walk to everything in St Germain des Pres, easy walk to Notre Dame, Ile de la Cite, Louvre, Musee D'Orsay, Invalides, etc."

We stayed in the Saint Germaine Lovely One Bedrrom for three weeks and were very comfortable and loved our time there. It was the perfect location for everything you may need, supermarket, metro / bus lines, patisserie and attractions. The apartment is as seen in photos with great sized bedroom and smallish lounge and tiny kitchen. The sofa bed in the lounge was comfortable and it just needs to be packed up for room in the lounge if needed, but we sat on the bed most of the time. We loved the large windows which let a lot of light and breezes in - gorgeous. The kitchen is tiny but quite functional and we had no problems making any meal we needed. The neighbors were all very courteous and we were made to feel welcome by all we met. Yes, there are a few things that don't work (such as the powerpoint in the bathroom) or squeaky floors but it is a beautiful old apartment building which adds to the charm. If you can't handle that get a hotel room! All communications with Nicolas and our concierge Santiago were wonderful. We were meet by Santiago who settled us in and provided assistance when our hot water ran out ( I think this was my fault by tripping the power safety switch by trying to use my hair dryer - they have one in the apartment FYI). We rang and Santiago was there in an hour and a half and fixed the problem. Nicolas and Santiago were also very supportive with my mother staying with a friend for the last week and they provided reassurance they would be there if she needed anything which she didn't in the end. Overall we had a wonderful interaction and stay. The surrounding area of St Germaine & the 7th district is IMHO the loveliest area in central Paris.
Nice apt with a charming bedroom. Fabulous floor-ceiling windows. Fabulous location. Really quiet street with galleries everywhere in the neighborhood. Only drawbacks are teensy kitchen but thumbs up for having toaster oven and microwave as well as the 2 little rings. Heads up that apt is completely self-catering. Tea, coffee, milk , etc will need to be brought/bought. Only other pet peev would be that bedroom & bathroom door are a little swollen and don't close perfectly. Concierge was very obliging. Transfer of keys etc was flawless...
It was a great week! Nicola's Staff were really helpful and everything went out smoothly. The bedroom is quite big - specially for a parisien apartment. The location couldn't be better. The living room and kitchen were a bit tiny, but you wants to stay indoors or cook when in Paris? The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. I highly recommend it - even better for a couple as the sofa bed is kind of old! The only thing that bordered: you can hear everything that comes from the apartment next door: steps, (email hidden)d one night the neighbor cofed the whole time!
Excellent location in the center and in a very quiet and safe street. Communication with Nicolas has been good, quick and concrete. The very comfortable apartment with a pleasant feeling of being home. We spent a fantastics days in Paris Nicolas's apartment. I recommend it enthusiastically.
We were pleased with the flat rented in late March 2012: - Location: walking distance to most of the popular places we wanted to visit in Paris; we did visit some museums nearby twice. Very important to have a city map on hands - Convenient to buy food or dine out: grocery stores, bakery/coffee shops and supermarkets are nearby; also some good restaurants located within 10- to 15- minute walking - the flat provided most of the necessities for travellers, and was comfortable to accommodate two persons - your prompt responses to our booking inquiries was also important to finalize our selection
Nicolas was amazing, he really helped me out with one of his places in a last minute situation. The apartment was super cosy, well decorated, clean and the BEST location. I highly recommend staying there!

My husband, daughter, and I recently stayed at """"Cosy"""" for a long weekend in Paris. The apartment was very nice and the St. Germain location was perfect. Thanks Nicolas for a wonderful stay!
We stayed four nights with two teen age boys. It was a very comfortable apartment including the sofa bed. It is very well located close to the underground station Cardinal Lemoine. It is also quiet at night,clean and very safe. If there was anything to change I would add a small wardrobe to hang clothes if people were staying longer. I would recommend the boulangerie close by that makes great chaussons aux pommes and croissants for breakfast. Restaurants are better at the bottom of the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine and also not to forget the market rue Moufetard. We would stay again, Merci Nicolas et Santiago
NICOLAS MET US ONTIME AND SHOWED US AROUND THE APARTMENT. THE LOCATION IS EXCELLENT, IT IS SAFE AREA, AND WE REALLY ENJOYED OUR STAY.
Good apartment, excellent location, easy to access as its on ground floor, more spacious than a hotel room and clean and convenient as has everything necessary - from table to small kitchenette. Nicolas was easy to deal with, prompt replies and we had no problem checking in and checking out. Would stay here again!
The apt was exactly as described and the location perfect for getting to the Louvre, Tuileries, d'Orsay, etc.. We were able to walk to everyplace of interest. For us, the best features were that it was very quiet (ground floor), modernly furnished, modern bathroom and had a big comfortable bed (hard too find that in Paris). Working with Nicholas was very easy, he accommodated our schedule for key pickup and checkout. Definitely recommend this apt and Nicholas. Hope to visit again!
This is a wonderful apartment in a charming and convenient neighborhood. It is really as described. Nicolas was very accommodating and all went smoothly. I stayed there with my husband and 10 year old son and it was perfect. We would definitely return. Many thanks.
Even if i stayed at another apartment the stay was perfect. Nicolas is a great host, everything was perfect and the flat is amazing! And the location is great, in a quiet aera the subway. I'll definitively come back here !
i will write very honestly. first, the flat is not exactly like on the picture. the sofa is old and a bit dirty , and no sofa table which they just put a box with one wooden board... the flat is nice, good to live for one person. i like the most is all the sound system. but... when i check in, the flat was not clean.... dirty food in the frige. Nicolas sent somebody to clean after. he did came once when i could not connect the wifi. he helped for it. but there was one broken light in kitchen, he said he will come to fix it but never came in one month....the bed is also not exactly like on the picture either...one convinient is very close to Gare du nord. but i didnt like the aera....
Nicolas's flat was as promised. Modern, clean lines and the added bonus of being in a gorgeous old building on one of the nicest streets in st germain. I was met promptly, given keys and a tour of place and enjoyed a fabulous week in my very own home in Paris. Will definitely book again. Thanks heaps"

Great location, we were very well looked after by the host. Only downside was the creaky floor and cranky downstairs neighbour. Fortunately this didn't ruin our experience as we spent most of the time out seeing the wonderful sites of Paris.
Shabby Chic is a great place to enjoy a true Parisian experience in the heart of the rive gauche, with all the stylish and noblesse of it. The flat has got a true character and personality, with all its nice imperfections. It's filled with the atmosphere and the uniquennes of a charming place. the guardienne is very kind too.
The location is great just few minutes walk to Saint German, Orsay musium and very near to St. micheal around where you can find many Pris attractions. The appartment was clean Located in 4th floor with the lift.
We loved the apartment and location! There were five of us - parents and 3 teenagers and there was plenty of space. The building is very old and the floor in the main room squeaks more than the others (the downstairs neighbor would knock on their ceiling if we so much as walked in the room) The beds were all new and clean and the large dining room made for a great gathering place. Everything in the apartment worked, including the wifi. We found the location to be very, very convenient and complete with a bakery down the street, a great cafe (L'Empire) and a large Monoprix grocery store around the corner (nicely located between the Metro and apartment). Nicolas and Ivan were reliable and made sure we got situated. The street is quiet in the evenings but gets a little noisy in the mornings around 7 a.m. but we had the windows open and it's nothing earplugs can't take care of. We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends!
Everything was just as expected, old traditional apartment. Did the job well! They did a great job with communication thru the whole process!

Super convenient and modern apartment very close to D'Orsay museum. We had a fantastic weekend at the apartment. The large bed was very comfortable and the place was extremely clean. My daughter and her friend, both 20, stayed on the pull out sofa and said it was also comfortable. Santiago met us for check in and check out. He was helpful and warm. We loved how the apartment used space efficiently and there was a lot of storage too with coat hangers too. Pictures are really true to the place. Bathroom was very cool. Loved the shower. We didn't really use the kitchen, but there was good small refrigerator, 2 burner stove, microwave, dishwasher and all the necessary utensils. There was a washing machine, but we didn't use it either. It's on the ground floor right off nice cobblestone courtyard. The apartment is conveniently close to Metro, Monoprix, some excellent restaurants, and an Eric Kayser on the corner. Can't wait to come back.
Very nice apartment, much lovelier than in the pictures. It was in a perfect location. Santiago was a great help and acted promptly to rectify any problem. I would definitely be happy to stay there again.
Nicolas was a great host - my first time using AirBnB and it could not have been better. The apartment was everything it promised and great location, easy to access, close to everything you want for a stay in Paris - restaurants, bistros, bakeries, fresh food, shops and attractions. The features in the apartment were great and spot on for what we needed during our stay. Would look to stay again when we are next there. Thanks.

Great place! Very good location, nice building and the apt is very well equiped. Heating, wifi and the basics for cooking. And lots of good books to read! Would definitely come back.
A very nice apartment, in a good area. Santiago was a good host and very friendly. He must us there on arrival and was prompt in meeting us on departure. There was a bit of an issue with a blocked drain but nothing a plumber couldn't fix quickly. The only note to anyone thinking of booking is that it is 6 flights of stairs up, so you need to be fit to get up there! All in all, a good place and I recommend it.

Two metro stations are close to flat, a lot of buslines are there, so way to city center wasn't long. We tried all ways to get to center. There's boulangerie with awesome pastry right in the corner. We had breakfast in the lovely garden every morning.
C'est un petit coin de relax au coeur de Paris, à l'abris des bruits de la ville.. On y trouve tout même un chat qui vous réveille au velux... Et le Père Lachaise!!!
Everything was right where it needed to be. This is as true of the neighborhood as it is of the studio itself. Sleeping under a skylight was a particularly delicious experience. The hostess knows how to get you oriented and settled in. Recommended!
Nice small apt. with what you need for a short stay (we stayed 9 days). The stairs to the loft and bed are a bit steep but are very well constructed. Cannelle was very gracious. The number of electric outlets seems to be scarce so an extension cord would be nice.
Studio is small but has all you need. Bed is very comfortable. Large windows let in plenty of light. Quiet and generally quite nice. Neighborhood is residential area. 5 min walk to metro, 20-25 min ride to center of Paris, so not far from tourist sites. Lots of supermarkets and bakeries in the area for self-catering. Price is reasonable and overall a very good deal. Strongly recommended for those on a budget, especially for couples.
Bel appartement, agréablement décoré, dans une quartier atypique - Hôte réactif dans ses réponses - Je recommande!
Cannelle is a workmate. She's very nice, clean and responsable. Her flat is very peacefull, espacially after a day of walks in Paris. She knows everything about the town, so she can give you a lot of advices, and her english is much better than mine. I'm sure she will be an exelent host for you. Cannelle et moi travallons dans le même café. Elle est vraiment gentille, ordonnée et responsable. Elle connait très bien sa ville et son quartier et sera ravie de vous donner quelques conseils pour vos visites. Et son anglais est bien meilleur que le mien. Je suis certaine qu'elle sera une hôte parfaite pour vous. Celine
Cannelle is a very good friend. We traveled a lot together. I know her for six years and she's a lovely girl who always care for the others . Last year i stayed at her home for a while, and i really loved this place. The flat is on a cute a peacefull yard where i had my coffee every morning while listening to the birds. You can also, if you prefer, drink french wine with the sunset. The neighbourhood is really cool, with lots of french coffees, some bars and lots of parks. I really recomand this host and i can bet you will love her too.
Cannelle has a fantastic place that is cozy, and is a wonderful place to relax after a day of running around Paris. If you want to know what living in Paris is, you'll genuine experience staying at Cannelle's, which you will never get at a hotel/motel. Cannelle is a very thoughtfull and friendly host who knows everything about the neighbourhood, she can tell you about the great places to visit in Paris and the trendy restaurant and bars to go.
Cannelle is my sister and I recently convinced her to put her lovely flat on airb'nb. I love this appartement and espacially the little frontyard. When it's warm and sunny outside you will definitely love this place. Cannelle is a clean, responsible person and I have no doubt that she's a wonderful hostess. Charlotte"

The view was more than perfect!you can see the eiffel tour while you're relaxing in your bed!gael was very kind and helpful.he came to give us the key on time and also gave us a map with some instructions about using metro or where we should eat and drink coffee.when we visit again paris we definitely stay at gael's flat!
Beautiful apartment with a perfect view in a very nice neighborhood. Really great location to the M6 subway train and ideal walking distance to the Eiffel Tower. Thank you Gael and Sophie!
Our first Airbnb experience couldnt be better! Gael was a great host, showed us around and gave us a map explaining everything we needed to know about Paris. The flat is perfect, even if i tried i couldnt find a bad thing about it. Quiet and calm but central neighboorhood, the metro station is 3 mins away walking and you're close to everything, you have bus and RER stations really close too. The view of the eiffel tower from the balcony is amazing and the flat is cozy and big enough for a couple (the bed is especially big and comfortable!) All i have to say is good things about my experience, thanks Gael!
It is amazing place with amazing view! Gael was very welcome and helped us with host very quickly. Highly reccomend! :)
This apartment has been a real nice choice to stay during my one-week travel to Paris, attending to this travel proposes: visit and enjoy the City of Light! What better than stay in real central place, with a real nice view to Eiffel Tower?! Gael was waiting for us on time, has give us the city map and some Paris’s tips. Everything was according with what is announced in the site, except the internet access that was not working due some problems which were pending on the service provider support. The global experience has been very good and for sure that this is an apartment to recommend to our friends!
Our anniversary trip started off with ice at our home city, cancelled flight to Paris from DFW. Delayed departure from Heathrow to Paris. 12 hours later we landed at 9:45pm. Sophie and Gael stayed in touch with us by AIRBNB message and offered their mobile #. Most graciously were patient while we continued to update them with our delays. Our luggage didn't arrive in Paris. Gael and Sophie, out of the goodness of their kind hearts, continued to call British Airways in Paris to help gain the return of our luggage. 36 hours after arrive at Midnight Gael called to say the delivery person was 5 minutes away. Again, Gael and Sophie are truly the consumate hosts that AIRBNB must be striving to attract. We received a great tour of the apartment, and found everything we'd need for a 1 week stay. The view of the Eiffel Tower is amazing from the 5th floor. Sleep with the window open for an even more Parisian experience. 5 minute walk and you're on the bridge overlooking the Seine River, and full view of the Tower. Don't forget to watch it at the top of the hour after dark for a light show. We were delighted with how easy it was to make coffee, cook breakfast, and get ready each morning. With the free WiFi access we were able to stay in touch with work and home.. We highly recommend this apartment and any other of Gael's future listings. Our eternal thanks for so much of your gracious time in helping us have the most perfect trip in Paris!
I traveled to Paris for the first time in December of 2013. I was looking for an experience that would allow me to live like a local. I reached out to Gael and she was phenomenal. The flat was clean and it has a perfect view of the Eiffel Tower. Gael helped me and was nice when checking me in. She provided a map of the city for me, which she did not have to do and showed me the land. It was a great two days. I would definitely stay here if I travel back to Paris. I had a really nice time. Thank you Gael for providing a wonderful Airbnb experience.
We had really good time with Gael's home. Very clean, cosy, perfect view, nice location !! It was amazing for couple. When we go to Paris again, absolutely we'll stay there.
Have to say it was a great stay gael is a great host wine and chocolate were already waiting. He was really nice and waited for us even when we arrived late. The flat is great and the view was amazing enjoyed the balcony a lot. So if we will come to Paris again defenatly the place to stay."

An additional bonus is that you can walk to the Eiffel Tower within 15-20 minutes. You're also in walking distance from Rue Cler in 10 minutes. You're basically close to a lot of cute cafés, restaurants, bars, pharmacy, and a grocery store. The flat itself is on the first floor which is nice because you don't need to walk up stairs. The bathtub and toilet are in different rooms but that's not a huge issue. The place is also equipped with an oven, sink, dishes, a small fridge, and snacks! The place is overall very clean, and the pictures don't do justice. We were surprised by how much bigger it was. You will get a ton of privacy here since the host doesn't live in the flat. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. This is a perfect place to be especially after a long day exploring Paris! I highly recommend this place for anyone! About the host: Rodolphe was such an amazing host and I could not ask for better! He is always prompted with messages and even gave me and my boyfriend a bottle of champagne once we arrived. His lovely girlfriend, Laetitia, prepared a traditional Parisian dinner for us on our last day in Paris. His generosity and warmth made us feel very welcomed to a city we have never been to before. They made our first trip to Europe very fulfilling and meaningful.
Great apartment, great location, amazing host!! I really enjoyed my time there, highly recommended! Thank you very much for everything Rodolphe!! Merci beaucoup!!
The flat is located in a very central area of Paris, you can just walk near The Seine River in two minutes, shops and restaurants very close. I will not forget watching The Eiffel Tower when I was walking to buy a bread in the morning :) Beside it’s great location, it is also safe, quiet and comfortable. Nothing is absent inside, almost all furniture and everything is new and clean. We used rental bikes (velib) in the same street to see all central Paris without getting exhausted and paying anything to cab, bus or metro. It was fun. I think this is a good place for accommodation without any problems. The best of all was the owner, Rodolphe. He is a very kind man and he provided every convenience. Thanks for everything friend, it was very wonderful for us to meet you as well. To be honest, we weren’t expecting such warm welcome :) All appreciated. We are looking forward to see you in our country. And till then, good bye and take care ;)
Perfect night in the quietest neighbourhood. Would definitely recommend. Rudolphe provided everything for us, even left a little snack for breakfast. Incredible location near lots of bars and restaurants, a little walk from the Seine. Overall, a great value stay.
We stayed in Rodolphe's flat for 4 nights. We had an extraordinary host and the host was available all the time to help us with what we need. This place has its very own atmosphere and somehow we really felt at home there. The neighborhood is exceptional, very quiet, more central would be hard to find. Easily transported by Bus, Metro, Velib or walking for the best places in Paris. The flat was better than I envisioned a Paris apartment. I certainly will come back soon! Highly recommended!"

The apartment is really cosy, modern and clean. All the comforts you could ask for like a comfortable bed, clean towels and wifi. The host was super friendly and provided us with all the information we needed. When we came there was a bootle of wine waiting for us. In the apartment the host had also left a folder with useful information/tips for things to do and places to eat in Paris. The area was really nice with lots of nice restaurants and boulangeries, a great neighborhood! We will definitely recommend this apartment and host!
What can I say, I LOVED this apartment!!!! My friend and I had an amazing time in Raphelle's quirky apartment in the 17th arrondissement. When we arrived, there was a bottle of wine waiting for us and a fridge stocked with enough food for breakfast. Raphaelle's eye for decor is amazing and we really enjoyed the look of her apartment. The bathroom was clean, large and modern, with complimentary towels. The bed was incredibly comfortable and there was wifi. The cherry on the top is the lovely terrace, perfect to have breakfast or to enjoy a drink! We couldn't have asked for more. Having lived in Paris many years ago, the location of the apartment is great! It's in the 17th district, you are definitely in the nice part of the district in a great neighborhood that still feels alive yet is quiet enough for a good night's sleep. There are many Boulangeries, which were great for our morning pastries and baguettes!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this apartment.
Before moving to Amsterdam, I lived for 3 years in this friendly and lively neighborhood and wanted to stay here while in Paris for a wedding. So I was excited to find Raphaelle's apartment. It's very quiet, so you can't hear any street noise. Its convenient location can't be beat! I definitely recommend her apartment for people coming to visit Paris.
Wonderful host and a great apartment with superb location!
Such a beautiful apartment in a great location. We absolutely loved Our stay.
I have spent a wonderful time in Paris and the flat was perfect. Is situated near the underground, in a road full of markets and life. I completely recommend it
We loved staying in Rapha's apartment! It was nicely furnished and a great size for how good the location was. She was a perfect host and we couldn't have asked for anything more!
Quartier agréable , appartement tres bien et tres bien situé pour visiter Paris, Tout était parfait
Appartement agréable et très éclairé, bien situé, dans un quartier animé quand il le faut. Tout ce dont on a besoin se trouve à portée de main. Raphaëlle est très cordiale. Bien qu'elle n'ait pas pu m'accueillir en personne, elle s'est assurée de ce que je ne manque de rien. Séjour très bref, mais très agréable. J'y retournerais volontiers.
Rapha was very helpful during our stay. We did not get to meet her, but we did stay communicated before and during our tripo to Paris. Pros include that the apartment was very clean, located in a nicer neighborhood, lots of tiny stores on the street, and Rapha left everything for us to use and even left us a bottle of wine that we really enjoyed. Cons: the apartment was cold and the heater did not work, the bathroom is a little old and the toilet does not worl perfect. Overall, it is a good deal for your money. Thank you again Rapha.
Thanks Raphaelle for a wonderful little flat in the PERFECT location. Wonderful directions from the train station and beautiful markets just outside the door. Highly recommended!
My partner and I recently stayed 3 nights in Raphalles Paris apartment everything was great, awesome location, pretty little street with lots of little shops, comfortable bed, very clean! And though we didn't meet our host she was in contact with us every day through email to see if we were enjoying our stay which was lovely! Would highly recommend this place for anyone staying in Paris"

We easily walked to most places: Notre Dame, Pantheon, Louvre. Julien is strict about the house rules but he is also very nice and friendly. He gave us very good advice on restaurants and places to visit and made sure we felt like home. I definitely recommend Julien and his studio in St. Germain des Pres!
Good location, near to the Metro and accessible to all the tourist attractions such as the Lourve, Notre Dame and Seine River. Julien is very accommodating and gives good recommendations on dining places and will give advice on where to shop and eat and which areas are safe to roam. We will rent the place if we visit Paris again ;) Only downside is there is no lift which is at the 5th Floor, do plan yourself, unlike me, with 3 languages and carrying them up and down was a Challenge :)
We loved our stay at Julien's! We felt very fortunate to have such a kind welcoming, especially after our flight was delayed. Julien was quick to respond to our questions and takes pride in renting his place. He has carefully thought about what his guests need when they stay in Paris... there was great guides for restaurants, sightseeing and general information. The flat was lovely... the terrace, the cleanliness, we loved it all. Thank you, Julien... we hope to see you again!!
Cozy little apartment in a great location. Very small and on the top floor of a 5 floor walk up. No elevator so plan accordingly. We left early in the day and stayed out until late so that we didn't have to climb the stairs more than we had to. Julien was very nice and helpful.
The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
This was a great place to stay for our weekend in Paris! It was in an unbelievably good location (close to some amazing restaurants and patisseries) as we were 10 minutes on the metro away from the city's main tourist attractions. Also, the accommodation was at a great price! Julien was extremely helpful and welcoming! I would not hesitate to stay here again!
We had a great stay in Paris! Unfortunately it was extremely cold so we could not make use of the nice patio area. The location is great and in walking distance from a lot of sites. There is a Velib bicycle station very close buy and would recommend using this system. It is great fun and a brilliant way to get around the city! Just beware, the apartment is on the 5th floor with no lift. This can be a problem if you have a lot of luggage or are not very active. Although tiring, we had no problem with this.
Julien's apartment was absolutely lovely - just as it looks in the pictures and perfect for our stay. I only wish we could have stayed longer! The apartment was very easy to find, Julien was a very good host and left us with recommendations on the local area and useful apps for our stay. We had everything we needed and more in that apartment with lots of lovely touches like the fairy lights on the mirror, the Nespresso coffee machine, a few useful bits in the fridge etc. The terrace really makes the apartment, it's an absolute gem and gorgeous to sit outside in the sun for breakfast. It is on the 5th floor with quite uneven steps up due to the age of the building so don't take too much luggage (!) but it's totally worthwhile for the place and the view. Thanks Julien, we'll certainly be coming back again!
The apt was lovely and cosy. It's in a perfect location and a really good base for all the main sights. We walked everywhere from there and it's only a few minutes walk to the Seine. Lots of lovely cafés and restaurants nearby. It was only a short walk from the train station and Julien was very welcoming.
Un hôte particulièrement accueillant qui a à coeur de vous faire passer une séjour agréable . Appartement charmant et cosy sans parler du quartier absolument """"the place to be"""". Allez y sans hésiter
L'appartement de Julien est conforme à la description. Il permet notamment de profiter de nombreuses commodités : Local à ski, parking couvert, grande terrasse (il est très agréable de profiter d'un chocolat chaud avec une telle vue après une bonne journée de ski...). C'est le père de Julien qui nous a accueilli, il a été très arrangeant au niveau des horaires d'arrivée et de départ et je l'en remercie. Je n'hésiterai pas à y revenir lors de mes prochains voyages au ski !"

And it is in an outstading location. But the very best of it is the host. Marc is kind, easy going, helpful. We highly recommend this apartmen for a stay in Paris.
Marc was a great host. The apartment is in a great location. Very nice accommodations. I would stay there again.
My friend and I recently stayed at Marc's property in Paris. The location and price can not be beaten! He is also a very gracious and kind host. He gave us maps of the city and metro. The space is indeed small, but if you are in Paris, you will rarely spend any time in the apartment. Thank you Marc for an excellent experience!
Perfect stay at Marc's. He was very easy to deal with from the start. Since he wasn't in town when we got there, we were able to leave the bags at the Concierge and walk around Paris before his friend came in and did the check-in. The apartment is small, but clean and has everything you need. Location is amazing, with at least three metro stops nearby. I highly recommend it.
We have just spent 4 nights in Marc's studio appt. They say good things come in small packages and we found this to be the case. Clean, well equipped and meeting our needs as explorers of the beautiful area. Added to this the friendliness and helpfulness of Marc both on arrival and departure. Amazing value for money. Our first airbnb experience....and not the last.
Marc is a wonderful host! The flat is small but creatively designed, so everything you need is there. It's very clean and cosy. The location is excellent.
I stayed at Marc's place with my boyfriend for the night and it was perfect. Marc was very helpful, punctual and even provided us with some maps and directions. The location is amazing, we were able to walk to most of the places we wanted to see and never spent longer than 20 minutes on the metro! Although the location seems lively with nearby restaurants are open until past midnight, the apartment was actually very quiet. The room itself is quite small but nicely decorated with all the facilities and more of a good hotel. After our stay we were able to leave our luggage at the concierge until the evening which made the rest of the day a lot easier. I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a place to stay in Paris, I really can't fault it.
My girlfriend and I stayed in Marc's amazing apartment for 11 nights, quite a bit longer than the usual length of stay of other people in the reviews. Although many say it would be too small for extended stays we totally disagree. The apartment has absolutely everything you need for a longer stay meaning we saved a heap of money by not having to eat out. Many say Paris is one of the most expensive places in their Europe holiday, it was one of our cheapest. The apartment is extremely quiet yet right in the middle of the city near everything you could need. Personally, I would say that the apartment is a little too close quarters for a long stay with a friend but as a couple or single it is perfect. I doubt you will find a better priced private apartment with all the utilities of Marc's anywhere in Paris. Marc was an amazing host and always gave us a hand with anything we needed (like printing our Disney tickets :). At the time of our stay Marc was doing up another apartment on the same floor which should definitely be something to look at if you need a bigger apartment than this one. Next time we visit Paris we will definitely try to stay at Marc's place again.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Marc's place in Paris. Marc's apartment is centrally located to a lot of attractions. The metro stop is just a five minute walk. Grocery story is a couple doors away. Marc was quite helpful with everything, even recommending a place for Woody to get a haircut and a doctor if we needed one, as we had colds. We definitely recommend Marc's apartment to anyone wanting to see the sights in Paris.
Appartement très bien situé. Très propre. Contact facile ! Merci
Nice week in that cosy room in the Marc studio close to the center Paris. Marc is a very helpful host. I recommend to stay with Marc.
génial : c'est le 1er mot qui nous vient à l'esprit quant on pense à notre séjour chez Marc !! accueil chaleureux et discret à la fois, disponibilité. Quant au studio, il est parfait, propre, décoré avec goût, très clair et au fond d'une cour donc d'un calme absolu. Nous avons pu faire presque tout ce que nous voulions à pied, tant il est bien situé ! la description donnée par Marc est absolument conforme ; bref, l'adresse à garder absolument ! merci Marc !!!
I got the appartmento to my brother, who was really surprised of how great a small place can be! He loved the place and the location, so close to all beatifull momuments in Paris! Marc gave goods tips to reach the appartament from the airport and was so available! I can't wait to come to Paris and reserve this appartment to myself.
The appartment is small, but well equipped with everything one needs. Perfect location in the center of Paris, you can reach anything on foot. The bed is really comfortable, perfect for 2 person. The building is charming and the interior is beautiful. By staying in this appartment and this building one can experience the actual life of a parisien. Marc is a wonderful host, available 24/7, he helped us with everything. To sum up, we can only recommend him!
My mother and I, stayed at Marc's beauty studio. So,what say! Marc is great host ever- frendly, kind, attentive and open-minded. Location of studio is perfect in the heart of Paris in a very beautiful building. You have anything may you need: clean kitchen with many dishes, fridge, kettle, microwave, even tea, coffee, oil and mustard) wifi is fast. There is a supermarket near the apartment, if you want to cook. so, everything was wonderful!!! I highly reccomend Marc! We would stay there again. Tnx, Marc!
Studio refait à neuf, très bien équipé, rien ne manque et au calme. Parfait pour un court séjour à Paris. Un grand merci à Marc.
We had a great stay in Marc's nice apartment. The location is really good and Marc is the best host ever.
We had a wonderful experience in Paris, specially because of Mark's apartment, that was in a great location, cleaned and equipped with anything you may need during your stay in Paris.Moreover Mark was always in touch with us before and during our days in Paris.If we are back to Paris we would love to stay again there.
L'appartement de Marc est idéalement situé en plein cœur de Paris. Propreté, accueil, calme parfait : excellent !"

She was very accommodating to me, and helped ensure I got some good rest after a sleepless night of travel. Her place is small but very tastefully done, and the space is uniquely situated at the top of the building, with an asymmetrical arrangement. She is very clean and organized as well, I highly recommend her as a host. As a bonus, her place is literally adjacent to a very old and architecturally beautiful church, immediately above fashion stores and gourmet restaurants, and is less than 400 meters to Les Halles (a major transportation hub) and just another 100 meters or so to the Lourve. Wonderful experience all around! Thanks Cassia!!"

An easy walk from the RER (subway from airport) and a neighborhood I was happy to live in for a few days. The apartment offered everything I needed: comfortable bed, lots of light, good kitchen and reliable wifi. Julie was so kind, and made great recommendations. When I told her I was going to the Louvre, she told me about a lovely cafe nearby and whenever I had a question, she responded promptly. I'll be visiting Paris again and hope to stay at Julie's apartment next time too.
I just returned from a 5 day stay at this beautiful apartment. The apartment is well renovated, sunny, serenely decorated, and quiet at night (noise from the children in the courtyard was during the day and since I was out it didn't bother me). It truly is excellently situated right on a popular pedestrian street lined with restaurants and all kinds of specialty food markets. It is in a perfect location to see the sights and walk everywhere. I went to all the major museums and only took the metro once when I found myself too far after a long day. Julie was wonderful to communicate with and I would stay here again in a heartbeat!
Excellent apartment , very well located . It is in a small street full of commerce , restaurants, bars, bakeries, in short, everything that one expects to enjoy the Parisian life. You can walk in about 15 min to Louvre and there is a metro station practically on the apartment door. At night it is very quiet and although in the morning you can see and hear children playing in a school does not bother at all! The apartment is in very good condition, bed and sofabed are comfortable, with good bedding , good conditioned, well equipped kitchen . I enjoyed buying bread and cakes in nearby bakeries and have breakfast in the apartment! Cleaning the apartment was also very appropriate. Julie was a wonderful hostess , responded promptly and helped us enjoy the ride! Undoubtedly I hope to return and would recommend to any friend!! Thanks Julie !
My sister and I had a great 4 night stay at Julie's apartment. The apartment was clean and well looked after and the bed was very comfortable. The location was perfect. Lovely busy street, with lots of good bars and restaurants. We also found it was in walking distance of centre Pompidou, Notre Dame and the Louvre. Julie was very welcoming and helpful. We had no problems. Perfect long weekend in Paris and we would definitely stay in Julie's apartment again.
We found the apartment to be smaller than expected in the pictures, so it was a bit tight for 3 people. However, Julie was extremely helpful if we had any problems, as one time the internet was being weird so she came by immediately to help. I will mention there is a school downstairs, and there was occasionally some noise from the children. Otherwise it was a nice stay!
Our last-minute request for an apartment in an ideal location was answered by Julie, and our experience was fantastic. We arrived and couldn't have been happier with the location. The apartment itself has everything one could ask for, and really made us feel comfortable after long days exploring the city. Julie made sure all questions were answered and any problems remedied at once. I only hope to be able to come back and stay here again, as I need a little more Paris in my life! Thanks, Julie, for a wonderful time in Montorgueil:) Kyle
Magnifique! This was an exceptional good Paris experience with Julie's apartment. The location is amazing, we just stepped out of the house entrance directly into the lively Rue Montorgueil, which is full of restaurants, unique grocery stores and people, tourists as well as Parisiens. Directly at the corner is a metro and bus station. Just opposite the entrance a supermarket and next door a big boulangerie. In 10 min stroll we were at les Halles. The apartment itself is spacious, clean and very bright. The bed is very comfortable for two people, the couch in the living room very cozy. The kitchen has the most important utilities to cook some small meal. We appreciated the integrated microwave in the stove; we bought good quality frozen food in a """"Picard"""" store nearby. Yes, the windows of the apt directly faces the courtyard, with spirited school children during the whole day, but thanks the soundproofed windows this was not problem at all, even not for our afternoon nap. We actually enjoyed these inspiring little devils ;-) , to the point that we really missed them on the school holiday wednesday! Julie was so exceptional friendly, responsive, understanding and flexible. Even though we booked indeed in the very last minute, it was not a problem at all for Julie, unbelievable! Summary: Very strongly recommended, thank you so much, Julie!
We stayed at Julie's apartment for two nights while in Paris. The location is indeed perfect – 3 metro stops nearby, one directly around the corner from the building. Also very easy to get to/from CDG airport with line B at metro Les Halles which is only a short walk away. Rue Montorgueil is absolutely charming if you like food shopping, always busy bistros and watching the hip Parisian crowd. The apartment is very bright, high ceilings and big windows facing the courtyard. Everything was nicely prepared, very clean, a brand new carpet, extra pillow and a blanket if you need it; you can also regulate the heater yourself, good wifi connection. Julie is a wonderful host - very attentive, immediately responds to any questions or requests you may have and it has been a pleasure to have stayed at her place.
I scoured AirBnB for a rental at Montorgueil which was where I wanted to be. Although this apartment's cost was on the higher end of comparable offerings, I took it because it is in a building with an elevator and the website pictures looked ok. The building and walkway to the apartment are under construction but the scaffolding, tools etc pose no hazards. Carpet was very dirty; Julie volunteered that it will be replaced soon; so it was not cleaned. She did not explain the crumpled paper trash in a corner of the room, the dirty linen left in a trunk in the bedroom, a can of paint and dried brush near the window ledge, dirty cooktop, dirty glasses, the broken bathroom floor tiles, the bath towel with a glob of dried hair, the fresh blood stain on the mattress of the pull out bed. I was pre charged a cleaning fee with my booking but the apartment was obviously not cleaned before our arrival. The lack of consideration for paying guests does not end with obvious lack of cleanliness. Better directions to find the apartment could easily have been given but were not. The apartment is not easy to find even for a well seasoned traveler such as myself. A kind passerby was nice enough to call Julie to obtain further information. For very little additional expense, the apartment could be furnished more comfortably for guests but was not. The main bed was comfortable but the pull out bed was lumpy. A huge 4 ft by 4 ft metal coffee table needs to be moved out of the way to use the pull out bed. The pillows came in different small sizes as if for a child's bed and were not comfy. Two bath towels and two smaller ones were supplied for two people for our entire 4 night stay, which would be ok but the towels were hard and then there was the previously mentioned errant hair ball. The shower drained really slowly... Water overflows onto the bathroom floor with the briefest shower. The apartment had no phone for local nor trunk calls. The closets held stuff like two ironing boards etc and one could not hang clothes in them. The apartment is on a differently named extension of Rue Montorgeuil and is not on the end closer to Les Halles. So we ended up using the subway to get to places. It is still a nice location with many nearby food stores, eating places and metro stop. It does have wifi, refrigerator, cooktop, small washing machine, many heaters, room darkening drapes, good water pressure, good supply of toilet paper. It is a quiet apartment and offers more space than the usual hotel rooms in France. All in all, if housekeeping could be improved, this would be a decent place to stay in the area for independent travelers. Not a good value, but not a bad one either."

Alvin responded promptly to any queries prior to our arrival. No problems, would happily stay here again.
We had been very satisfied with Alvins apartment. He was a good host. The central location of the apartment is excellent for any Paris tourist.
this apartment is really nice and very well located, just as pictures show. although bathroom and kitchen are really small the two bedrooms and living room are perfect for a 3/4 people stay. all was clean and tidy and alvin is really nice. i messed up the check out time, thought we could stay a little longer and the cleaning lady arrived and we were sleeping. alvin was still very nice and gave us an extra hour to leave the ap. thank you very much, a great place to stay in paris!
Beautiful apartment in the best location is what our apartment is called - and that's exactly what it is! Comfortable, stylish, clean, and walking distance to all the big sights. Felt like real Parisians, going out every morning to the boulangerie a few minutes walk away, to buy our fresh baguettes and croissants. And so lovely coming back to a comfortable home. Felt that Alvin was always on hand if we needed him, he answered our queries promptly, we didn't meet him but he seemed a friendly and helpful host. Merci beaucoup, Alvin!
We very much enjoyed our stay in the apt of Alvin! The DIY check in was pretty easy and it's so central and safe, yet not on the busiest streets of le Marais / les Halles. Alvin was friendly to give us all info we needed. The place was clean and felt modern (clean and modern bathroom and toilet which I find important) with a classic look & feel. The beds in both rooms were very comfortable. The least favorite were some lost drunken tourists that started singing at night but I guess thats what you can expect being in central Paris ;-) thanks alvin for the great stay!
We had a great time in Alvin's Apartment. There was plenty of space for the 4 of us and it was a great position for getting around. The restaurants/cafes and shops all just meters away. Thanks Alvin.
This is a fantastic Parisian apartment. We absolutely loved this neighbourhood and spent our days trying all the amazing eateries nearby. Just a walk to the Louvre it was really central for us. The apartment was very clean and well maintained and exactly what we had expected. Best of all the beds were comfortable and there was free Wi-Fi. Alvin was great with all his communication and I appreciate your quick responses. All in all a wonderful stay.
We had a great time in Alvin's apartment. Its location is just perfect. The flat is small but offers everything you need for a stay in Paris. Alvin was a great and helpful host asking us if everything is fine upon arrival. We'll come back to this place.
This apartment is great! Four of us (two couples) stayed here for a week, and we really enjoyed the apartment. It's in a great location, close to a pedestrian market street with many restaurants around. Alvin was an excellent host with great communication. He responded to all of my questions very quickly and was very helpful. I would happily stay here again.
Overall a really great experience. I had been to Paris before - but normally stayed in hotels. This was a much better option - as it had two good-sized bedrooms, a living room, a nicely fitted bathroom and a decent sized (for Paris) kitchen. The flat is located in a very central part of the Marais. Handy to access most parts of central london. The process to get into the flat was very simple and clear - and Alvin was very responsive by email with some questions I had. Would strongly recommend this flat.
Our stay at Alvin's place in Paris was more than comfortable! The place is just as pictured on the photos. Alvin's hospitality was welcoming. We are uni students and one of us arrived almost at midnight and Alvin kindly answered her phone calls at that time and guided her. He welcomed us with a jar of cookies and a bottle of water which were really appreciated. The place is small but well located to nice restaurants and some landmarks like Notre Dame cathedral. The building is quite old and has a lot of stairs. Perhaps that can be a something to consider if you're traveling with a lot of luggage. Overall, the place is good and my first Airbnb experience was way better than expected. I would definitely stay at Alvin's place again and use Airbnb in the future.
My friends and I had the best experience in Paris and Alvin's apartment was the perfect place for us to stay. It is right by a metro station, and there are so many cute shops + delicious restaurants right around the corner. After exploring the city, it solidified my decision even more that the 5th arrondissement where Alvin's apartment is is one of the best places to stay. Very Bohemian! Alvin is a wonderful host who is flexible with your needs. My friends and I got there a little early and needed to drop our luggage off so we didn't have to carry it around town, and Alvin was more than happy to let us drop our bags off early. We were so thankful. Thank you again Alvin for allowing us to stay in your apartment. It made our Paris trip complete! Katie, Tiffany, and Li
A comfortable apartment in a great location, Alvin's instructions and information were spot on. We were prepared for the 4 flights of stairs which were not as bad as we had anticipated. Both my Mum and I had comfortable nights sleep in the bedroom and also on the pull down bed in the lounge. Everything you could need is in the apartment, from the Nespresso coffee machine to steam iron. Lots of guide books and useful information are available for you to read on the table. We found the area to be conveniently located with plenty of bars and restaurants close by. We would thoroughly recommend a walk down Rue Mouffetard for fabulous food and wine shops. Aptly described by Hemmingway in 'A moveable feast' Being on the top floor be prepared for a few feathered friends as your neighbors - this was the only noise we heard all weekend. Would recommend Alvin's apartment to other visitors to Paris. Our top tip would be to take a stroll through Jardin des Plantes and have mint tea outside in the mosque cafe.
Чудесная уютная просторная квартира в центре Парижа! Мы останавливались на 8 дней. В квартире есть все необходимое, Alvin был всегда на связи и был готов нам помочь. Найти квартиру было достаточно просто, хозяин дал четкие и понятные указания. В шаговой доступности много магазинчиков, рядом также небольшая площадь с барами и ресторанами, очень милое и оживленное место. Мы остались очень довольны нашим проживанием!
The apartment is comfortable and cozy in a perfect location in central Paris. Easy access to the Metro and a short walk to any number of shops, restaurants etc. Quite and safe, the only thing that may be a challenge for some is the eight flights of steps (4th floor walkup) to the apartment. Really best for two people as you'll need to keep your suitcase in the sitting room. Real bed in the bedroom was comfortable for two. Alvin was a great host. He provided plenty of information and provided all the information we needed. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable and affordable place to stay in the heart of Paris. Thanks Alvin.
We felt so lucky having chosen Alvin's lovely apartment for a 3 night stay. My first Airbnb experience. Alvin was the perfect host to us and everything - from the large tea mugs to the dragonfly doorknobs - pleased us. It felt like a home from home, well furnished & decorated in warm colours, great lighting, good shower & kitchen, very comfortable chairs and bed and around the corner, passing by an apartment where Ernest Hemingway lived, is the most perfect little cafe-filled square - what more can I say apart from that we would love to stay here again!
Alvin's appartment was the perfect choice to experience Paris lifestyle. The appartment is cosy, clean, and perfectly located in the middle of the vivid Latin quartier. You can either take your coffee in the kitchen of the appartment or just walk around the corner to rue Mouffetard and pick one of a bunch of nice cafes! This road is really great and you will find nice brasseries as well as grocerys, wine shops, crepe places, patisseries, etc. Infrastructure could not be better, the metro is three minutes away or if you decide to take a bike, the next velib station is close as well... Absolutely recommendable! Unfortunately we had not the chance to get to know Alvin in person, appartment access is organized independantly. Nevertheless Alvin was reacting promptly on email requests in case we had a question.
What a great little apartment! Very convenient, metro stops very close buy, lots of shopping and restaurants nearby.
We had a wonderful stay - such a cute apartment with everything you could need and really easy to find with Alvin's instructions. A fanatic location with two metro stops and lots of yummy restaurants and bars just round the corner. Our favourite was a Vietnamese restaurant called Saigon-Pantheon. I would highly recommend staying here!
Alvin's place was clean, cozy, stylishly decorated, perfectly equipped, and ideally located. Check-in and check-out were extremely easy, and he even let us leave our bags for the afternoon, which was extremely helpful. Thanks to the efficient use of space, three adults (including two very pregnant women) stayed very comfortably in this apartment. Directions to the apartment were accurate and tips he left about where to go/ what to do were right on. This is the perfect location for a walkable weekend in Paris, and I will definitely try to stay at Alvin's place next time I'm in the city."

The neighborhood permits you to see how the french people really lives, because it is not such a tourist place. The owner is very helpful. There was nothing that have fumbled, but the follow points could be solved to make the stay even better: 1. The owner asks us not to get in the flat with shoes, because de carpets are white. It is kind of uncomfortable. 2. There is a boring neighbor that complains about noise, even if you just walk normally trough the flat. 3. We found some insects in the kitchen.
Staying in Alexandra was absolutely delightful, rue Montorgueil is a wonderful street full of life, shops and exactly in the centre, minutes walk from louvre. I would highly recommend this place for people who look for a quite place close to the centre, clean and fully equipped. Alexandra was amazing, everything was as described and even the last day she let us stay a bit longer because we had the flight in the evening. Wath else? ★★★★★
The apartment is located in a very central and busy area, but also very quiet. Lots of coffee and small restaurants on the street, metro is few steps away, Great location, and the host is very nice and helpful.
we enjoy the rue Montorgueil a very parisian place the flat is nice handy and very clean we'll come back with pleasure thank you alexandra
Great Little place on Rue Montegueil on the right bank of Paris, a pedestrian street full of cafés, restaurants, bakeries and supermarkets. Very well connected as it is literally about 1 minute walk from Sentier Metro station. For those who are used to bigger bathrooms, be warned there isn't enough space between the toilet and the shower. But given its central location, the small bathroom isn't surprising, as Parisian flats aren't big. We would come back again to this flat.
Very nice little appartment, perfectly located, super clean and functionnal. And the bed was great!!! Alexandra was very reactive and helpful. The only downside was the neighbour who kept banging on the walls when I was just WALKING in the apartement to go from the bedroom to the kitchen for example and this, without even wearing shoes. Alexandra put carpet everywhere in the apartment to not disturb her but still she kept banging on the walls as if I was having a party upstairs! There is only one towel provided per guest so you might want to bring extra towels with you. The washing machine came in very handy though, it has an express 15mn cycle. All in all I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone who wishes to visit Paris. It´s close to everything, 3 metro stations around the apartment and the best bakery in all Paris """"Stohrer"""" is located almost in front of the apartment! Thank you Alexandra for a very nice stay!
I stayed in the apartment of Alexandra for almost two weeks. The apt is cosy and fully equipped and efficiently organized. The CD player was not working, but Internet and the WiFi system was perfectly operating. There is also a printer (I did not use it) which can be useful if you have to work or prepare stuff from home.. Although I did not see Alexandra upon arrival and departure, communication was efficient and I had no problem in getting in and leaving on departure. I certainly recommend the apartment as the location is great.
The reservation was canceled 21 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
The flat is great, even better than expected. The street is central and perfectly located if you have a special passion for delikatessen. In spite of the central location, the flat was quiet and cosy and clean. Overall we recommend it heartily.
The most important thing,the location was definitely very convenient and pleasant, just as the owner describes; the street it's on does have lots of nice bakeries / cafes / wine shops, and lots more on side streets. It was pretty easy to come from the airport as well, though there is some ongoing construction by the nearest RER station that got me twisted around when first trying to find my way (this was following an overnight flight in economy class so my brain probably wasn't functioning fully). The apartment was comfortable and had everything needed. Comfortable bed, surprisingly no noise from the street even with some windows facing that way, Internet worked reliably, shower water pressure / heat was good (which sometimes can be an issue in older buildings). Possible downsides: it's inevitable but its an older building in a big city, so you can sometimes hear a bit of noise from other residents, the stairs in the building are bit uneven. None of this was enough to really bother me personally though, and overall it was a pleasant stay."

The place is very well located for the Popidou and the commercial area. The only advise for travellers would be to think that there is no lift and is 4th floor, and that there is a 30e cleaning fee to add to the final price. All was great, thanks.
Good location, cozy flat. Nice 4th floor view. Fairly quiet for a busy location. There were lots of tour guide books that were helpful. However, keys not available for 4 hours after agreed check in time. Flat had dirty sheets, towels and dishes and trash can full. Cleaning lady hadn't been in yet. Even after she came did not have toilet paper. Not a good first experience w Airbnb:(
DO NOT STAY HERE. Unclean. Unit is dirty, did not have toilet paper and the light/electricity in the only bedroom did not work. Poor, confusing communication - conflicted and always changing instructions that made it inconvenient for the guest. Attempted to steal the security deposit after having a """"cleaning lady"""" invade the property unannounced at the ridiculous time of 7am on the last day. Check out was noon. Lady did not knock or notify in advance - simply walked into the flat at 7am while guest was sleeping and then would not leave. MY ONLY NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE EVER on Airbnb. Do not ruin your vacation at this place.
this was a wonderful trip at a wonderful flat in a wonderful area! the flat was cosy and the front room was lovely and spacious, and the view was so romantic and quirky. apart from some missing lightbulbs which made some rooms with less natural light a bit dim the flat was clean and well-equipped and and we didn't need anything more. christine was communicative and helpful, even with questions which had already been answered and i had just forgotten! would definitely recommend and stay again.
Central location, and pleasant flat. Area quite shabby, but fine. Christine was very fast at responding by email to any queries.
L'appartement est conforme aux photos et nous n'avons pas eu de problèmes pour y accéder. Christine a été disponible par mail avant notre arrivée et flexible sur l'heure de départ. L'appartement se situe dans une rue où les taxis n'ont pas accès, n'hésitez pas à leur donner rdv au croisement entre la rue Etienne Marcel et la rue St Denis (visible depuis la fenêtre du salon). Nous n'avons pas eu de problème dans le quartier, bien que la rue soit assez passante et ceux jusque tard, pas de nuisances lors de notre séjour. Il n'y a pas de télévision mais la collection de CD est grande, nous n'avons en revanche trouvé que 2 ou 3 DVD, alors si vous avez peur de vous ennuyer, ramenez vos DVD pour utiliser le rétro projecteur. Très bon séjour dans cet appartement !
My boyfriend and I fully enjoyed our recent trip to Paris, and Christine's flat was the perfect base for our stay. It was just as advertised -- clean, well-furnished, and a generous amount of space for the two of us. We were appreciative of the kitchen, although we didn't use it much because of all the great dining options in the neighborhood, including Christine's excellent recommendation of Le Grappillon as the best local bistro, where almost everything features foie gras! The Centre Pompidou is just a 5-minute walk away, and it is also an easy stroll to the banks of the Seine, Notre Dame, and the Louvre. Thanks to Christine for being an attentive host. We hope to be back soon!
great location, and photos are a correct indication of how the flat looks.
First time using airbnb and it was a positive experience! Christine's flat was amazing in both location as well as atmosphere. It is located really close to the metro as well as to some of the major tourist attractions (e.g.Notre Dame, Louvre) Bonus: Right downstairs there are lots of creperies and dining options. We had a lot of take away crepes and kebabs! The love hotels etc. were not troublesome. We felt safe walking down the street at night too. Christine's apartment was comfortable and we enjoyed our stay. (there are those flights of stairs- but you get used to it) It was colourful and felt very inviting. We could read books/listening to music/relax and watch the bustle of the streets below. We were there in the peak of Winter and the radiators kept us warm. All in all, a fabulous accomodation. Would recommend it highly
Nous avons passé 3 jours chez Christine, c'était tout bien organisé, elle était là quand nous sommes arrivés. Christine est très gentille et sympa, l'appartement est situé au centre ;on arrive à Notre Dame, au Louvre dans 15 minutes à pied! Il y a beaucoup de magasins (un petit supermarché à 30 mètres) et restaurants, nous avons très aimé le quartier et l'appartement - pas de bruit de voitures! La prochaine fois j'y retournerai! Merci Christine, cordialement, Helene
Très grand appartement, 2 chambres, dans un quartier super calme et ensoleillé et 10 minute à pied de la gare Schoenhauser Allee. Christine nous a mis a l'aise, et grosse chance d'être dans le quartier de Prenzlauerberg, l'endroit le plus branché de Berlin, avec beaucoup de bars et discothèques dans le quartier, le nouvel an est énorme à Berlin , les allemands aiment la fête ! A tous les amateurs de danse latine (Salsa, bachata, mambo et même kizomba !!!) vous avez le SODA CLUB dans ce quartier de Prenzlauerberg et des soirées pratiquement tous les soirs ! même le dimanche soir il y a une salle unique pour la kizomba !!! Merci christine

My first time visiting Marseille, and Christine was very helpful leading up to the trip. She answered many questions that I had during the planning of my trip, and was very responsive to emails and messages. Once I arrived (without hassle thanks to her detailed directions) the place was perfect for our week in Marseille. The apartment is very clean, but has the amenities you would find in an apartment where someone actually lives, which is nice. Overall, I would stay there again, and recommend her flat to everyone going that direction.
Writer's Nest is absolute heaven... and in PARIS France!! What could be better!!! !!! Felt like we were staying in wonderful old French luxury with original creaky wooden floors, cornices and windows that made one feel glamorous!!... nine nights over Christmas and New Years.. we didn't want to go out!!! But then the positioning in the Marais right next to the St Paul metro, across from the Cité means if you go out and want to come home.. it is so easy!! The only possible negative thing we could say, however we felt that with all the red wine we were drinking, it was a positive in the end!!! Are the four flights of stairs and no elevator. Quite common in France, possibly also why the French are so fit!!! But if you do have ailments, this may be of concern.... but nothing else could be faulted. We had a wonderful Christmas turkey dinner, the kitchen has an oven!! On the most fantastic linen and crockery, using the grandest cutlery... We felt so at home. Even cooked chocolate chip biscuits with our 10 year old niece when she came for a sleepover one night! Will most certainly make this our home in Paris whenever we visit! Thanks Christine and Philippe!!! Hope to meet you in person some day soon! Cheers Karee & Colin xx Must send you some photos!!
We had a fantastic stay at the appartment in Paris. It is a great location right in the heart of the Marais area, with plenty of restaurants, cafes, bakeries etc right at your doorstep. The appartment is up on the 4th floor of a great old Parisian building with lovely big windows overlooking a courtyard area giving plenty of natural light. It is filled with lovely old furniture and all the books on the shelves make it feel very comfortable. The apartment is very quiet at night, the queen bed is very comfortable and we slept very well. The shower is very hot with good water pressure. The kitchen is small but functional, and there is coffee, tea, sugar etc to use. The building has a security code entrance that is locked at night and the appartment is very secure. There is a metro stop right out the front of the building, making it great for easy transport. Christine was a great host to deal with, who is renting out the appartment on behalf of her friend. He left a great personally written note explaining the appartment, and with information of the surrounding area. We couldn't have been happier with the whole experience, and will definately rent the appartment again if coming back to Paris."

The location of the flat is just perfect in a very vibrant area and easy access to all sightseeings. Chokri has been an amazing host and very accommodative. As our eurostar train back to London was at 7 pm he let us check out at 5 pm despite the normal 12 pm check out time. We definitely stay in Chokri’s place again when we go to Paris next time.
A wonderful small apartment with the best location possible; an easy walk to many Metro lines and bus lines, and shopping of every kind on the adjacent Rue Montorgeuil. The bedroom was bigger than I expected from the pictures and had hanging space and shelving for clothes. The free wifi worked reliably with a very strong signal. Tiny bathroom, functional kitchen with basic equipment for cooking; it was nice to have paper products for both supplied, which does not always happen in vacation rentals. Rue Marie Stuart has a number of restaurants on it; with windows and shutters closed I was not at all bothered by noise, but my guess is that in summer if you are a light sleeper and want the windows open, you might want to bring earplugs. Chokri was very responsive to messages during the stay; when I discovered the coffeepot was broken he supplied a brand new one that same day and gave me a bottle of wine for the inconvenience. A very professional host. Highly recommended.
Rue Montourgueil è un cuore che batte a qualsiasi ora del giorno. Noi l'abbiamo vissuta dall'interno ed è strabiliante la vitalità di questo luogo. L'appartamento di Chokri è piccolo, molto carino e ben tenuto, ma soprattutto è in una posizione davvero strategica! Centrale e con due stazioni della metro molto vicine è il campo base ideale per partire alla conquista di Parigi. Il padrone di casa è sempre disponibile e a portata di chiamata o sms. Se siete in 3 (o massimo 4) è il vostro luogo. Da consigliare!!!
Chokri's apartment at Montorgueil is great! Location is good with various metro stations within walking distance and thete are many cafes, restaurants and a market downstairs. No problem with food in this area definitely, even if u have to catch a really late dinner at 11pm! The apartment itself is small but cosy and sufficiently equipped with basic kitchen utensils and equipment. Most importantly I had no issues with cleanliness. Only minor issue was that the bathroom is really small so one really has limited space to manoeuvre and you have to climb stairs up to the unit. Therefore may need to consider this if you go with heavy luggages. All the other factors definitely make this a recommended choice!
Studio Idéalement situé ! bien équipé ! Chokri a été un hôte efficace et discret ! Parfait je recommande !
We had a very good stay at this appmt. Chokri is a great help. The appmt is very petit, but has a good bed and sofa bed, the bathroom very small. The neighbourhood is great, all you want to eat and see is closeby, or easy to access with the metro. I would suggest this appmt to all my friends.
The flat is located in the heart of Paris. All is around. Montorgueil, Etienne Marcel, Les Halles... And the flat nice and very clean. Chokri was very attentive and helpful when I arrived. I definitely recommend this place.
Io, mio marito e mia figlia abbiamo soggiornato in questo appartamento in novembre. L'abbiamo trovato pefetto: pulitissimo, silenzioso, funzionale nel suo piccolo, caldo. E' situato in una delle migliori zone di Parigi ricca di piccoli negozietti per fare la spesa o mangiare """"al volo"""" qualcosa. E' situato a circa 100 mt dalla fermata Les Halles, una delle stazioni metropolitane più grandi. Chokri è stato veramente gentile, socievole, preciso nello spiegare la funzionalità dell'appartamento (chiavi, riscaldamento, ecc) e molto disponibile. Parigi è stupenda già da sola ma la realtà dell'appartamento e la gentilezza di Chokri ha reso il nostro soggiorno di sei notti ...semplicemente perfetto!!!!!!!!!
This apartment surpassed our expectation! Centrally located, wonderful neighborhood (make sure to explore the area. We found a very cute street with great restaurants, bakeries and groceries). Very comfortable. Very close to the metro. Some previous posters noted problems with the wifi but we had none. My 2 adult children and myself were on wifi a lot while in the apartment and never had difficulties. Tiny kitchen but we cooked several meals and made due. Dishwasher, washing machine, drying rack, microwave all worked wonderfully. Great shower. The only downside is the windows face a central area which looks like some kind of warehouse which was used for about an hour between 7:30 and 8:30 am M-F. Lots of talking from the workers. Didn't wake my kids but I would wake up (and then fall right back to sleep). No view. Despite this, I would definitely stay here again if I came back to Paris. Chokri is great at answering all my questions, fast at email and text replies, and he made arrangements for my daughter to pick up the key with no problems. We had French relatives come to Paris to see us and they were impressed with the neighborhood, central location, and quiet surroundings also. Can I say this again? You won't be disappointed staying here!
Amazing neighborhood, flexible and friendly host and an apartment that fits the description and looks like the pictures! Definitely recommendable :)
Everything was perfect. The apartment isn't too spacious, but we found everything we needed which is why it is perfect for a couple to stay. The metro station is 1min away and all the beautiful spots of Paris can be visited by foot. Moreover, the Quartier Latin and Le Jardin du Luxembourg are around the corner. If we come to Paris again, we will definitely ask Chokri whether we're allowed to stay in this comfy apartment again. Thanks, Chokri, for everything!
It was a perfect WE. We stayed in Chokri's flat this WE for 3 nights and we highly recommend this one. The flat is really quiet, bright with all things you need. It's close to le Marais, Place des Vosges, Place de la Bastille and perfect for shopping and having a peacefull and romatic WE. Thanks Chokri and enjoy your stay guys !
cozy, clean and comfortable apartement. Ideal place to stay if you are going to be spending most of your time outdoors, sightseeing. Airy and bright. very comfortable bed and nice strong, warm shower. Wifi was always available. Prime location. will definetly go stay again if we ever visit paris again. even though we had to check out at 12:00 pm, Chokri let us leave our bags in the apartement till 5:30 pm since our flight was departing only at 8:00pm. Thank you Chokri.
We had some really beautiful days in Paris and enjoyed the great location of Chokri´s flat. He is a really helpful and friendly host. The flat is quite small but cozy.
We stayed at the apartment for 4 nights, in early April 2014. It was great. The apartment is a small studio, well equipped, newly renovated, clean, and well organized. Flying in, we had concerns about the bed being a sofa bed. It turned out to be very comfortable. The location is perfect. A minute or two from the St. Germain metro station, and a great neighborhood. There's a large supermarket a minute away. Chokri the host was very nice, met us exactly when we set to meet, explained everything, and was very friendly. We had a great experience.
The apartment was nice and clean. Decorated mostly as a hotel room and therefor not very personal. It is very small but has everything you need. It is located perfectly, close to the Bastille metro station and Place de Voche and the area is filled with great restaurants and cafés. Chokri was very nice and I would definitely recommend this apartment, as the price is also very fair.
Small but perfect studio: good situation (2 minutes walking from st. paul station M1), very clean, modern, etc. perfect for two people!
This is a nice room in a fantastic location at the heart of the city. It's on a quiet street just steps away from Rue Montorgueil and all its cafes and restaurants, and it's within a few minutes walk from several metro and RER lines. Much of the city is within reasonable walking distance as well, for those who like to wander on foot. There was a bottle of wine and some chocolates waiting for me when I arrived. I don't know if this is standard (or perhaps because I was staying for 16 nights), but it was a very nice touch. The room is not large, but it's cozy and comfortable, and I never felt cramped. It's at the top of 5 flights of stairs and there's no elevator, which might be a problem for someone with health or mobility issues. Unfortunately, I was allergic to something in the room, which caused some problems throughout my stay (although I think it was aggravated by catching a cold at one point). I was never able to determine exactly what caused the allergy, so I can't give much useful information. I don't believe anyone had problems previously, so it's probably just a fluke that won't affect most people. Other than that, it was a great place to stay, and would be an excellent choice for anyone visiting Paris."

The apartment is very comfortable and you are near metrostations, Centre Pompidou and lots of bars and restaurants. Michel is very helpful, and the apartment is perfect for two people. We certainly would book again!
I rented Michel's lovely apartment for my mother while she was staying in Paris. Michel was great (almost instant) in replying to my emails and questions. He was very helpful and met my mum on her arrival. The apartment was very clean and comfortable and she enjoyed her stay immensely. The location is fantastic. Close to many metros, the Pompidou and the lovely boutiques and restaurants of La Marais area. There is also a large supermarket a few doors down if you want to eat in. I definitely recommend this apartment and Michel was fantastic. Thank you!
Lovely apartment in a great location - one block from Georges Pompidou and surrounded by nice cafes and restaurants. Very close to metro, supermarket and about 10 mins walk to the Seine. Bed really comfortable and the apartment was very clean with everything working - wifi was great and very useful. A couple of niggles which were outside Michel's control were workmen drilling at 8.30 in the morning (inside the apartment building) and the lift being out of order for repairs meaning lugging suitcases down 2 floors. However, these were temporary problems and nothing to do with Michel. We were met at the door and got good directions from Gare du Nord and back to CDG by taxi. All in all, a great place to stay if you want to stay in a good location - well worth the money. p.s. my husband objected to the tv being in the bedroom and not the sitting room but that didn't bother me.
The two of us stayed at Michel's apartment for a long weekend in mid-January 2014. Michel was responsive to my questions prior to arrival and offered to meet us at the flat upon arrival even though it was late at night. The flat is self- sufficient and we found it very nice having the option to relax and cook during our trip. The best thing about the flat is it's location. The area is nice to wander around with very easy access to supermarkets, food shops and centre pompidou. Hotel de Ville, The Seine, Notre Dame are only 20 minutes walking distance away. The apartment is right next to Rambuteau metro station. All in all a very enjoyable stay.
Michel's apartment is in a great location- Le Marais. Bakeries and brasseries abound and the metro steps away right outside his door. Very convenient, as you can be whisked anywhere in Paris in minutes. We found walking in Paris was the best way to really experience the city during our short 4 days there. We preferred the smaller more intimate streets to the big noisy ones. In fact, Rue du Grenier St. Lazare on which Michel's apartment building fronts is more like 8th Avenue in NYC. The apartment itself is clean, well kept, and comfortable, and our host very, very responsive, always ready to help out with a restaurant recommendation or cab solution. I was a little disappointed that we never met Michel, as he was out of town, but his friend was there to welcome us. One thing you should know about communicating in Europe (email hidden) only device- it's not easy to find a public signal when you need it. Martin's apartment has good wi-fi and we needed it and depended on it. If I had one criticism about the apartment it would be the hallway as you get off the lift. It's not very nice and poorly lit. Also no place to put clothes in the bedroom, but there is a wardrobe in the foyer. The bed is comfortable and the apartment quiet, but not much of a view. Shower was nice and hot. Overall, we recommend this. Terry Halle Wendy McAllister Stevenson, MD. USA
Our stay at Michels apartment was seamless and a pleasant experience.. A well kept place in a great location! We would his place to friends and family..
Our stay in Michel's apartment was top notch. It is centrally located- Marais top spots, Notre Dame, the Louvre all in easy walking distance. The apartment was very clean, quiet, spacious, and well equipped. A supermarket is downstairs and the metro 1/2 a block way. Michel was a perfect host. He provided amazing restaurant suggestions and neighborhood highlights. I highly recommend Michel's apartment.
Michel's apartment is perfectly located, immaculate, well equipped, and tastefully decorated. It is also quiet, which is very important, as it looks over a pedestrian courtyard. Very secure also. Michel is accessible by phone for anything as well, very accommodating! I would stay here again.
I think this apartment has everything you need, except for washing machines, but it does not matter. the apt is located near the the Pompidou Centre, and there are 11th metro station and the 29th bus station . This area is very quiet, and I feel safe. There are two supermarkets, three Chinese Restaurants, a Indian Restaurant opening all night. The rooms are spacious and clean， the pillows are very comfortable，and there are many maps and travel books on the coffee table which are useful for travelers, and so on, all of the things are quite wonderful. The most important thing，Michel is a quuite friendly host, he made ​​us feeling very comfortable and very happy. I hope the next time I come to Paris could stay here again.
My husband and I stayed at Michel's lovely apartment for about a week, and I would highly recommend it. Michel met us right on time in front of the apartment, and gave us a quick tour around the place, plus useful sightseeing tips. The apartment itself has a lot of personality, and is spacious, comfortable and clean. The location is hard to beat- it's walking distance from great shopping and restaurants. And as advertised, it was surprisingly quiet for being in such a central area. Another plus is the elevator in the building- no need to lug heavy luggage up and down flights of stairs. There were only two aspects that weren't ideal: no dining table (there is a counter in the kitchen), and the toilet room is somewhat inconveniently located on the other side of the apartment from where the bathroom is. However these are small things in an otherwise great apartment. Thanks Michel for sharing your beautiful flat!
Nous avons été très bien accueilli,le cottage est parfaitement situé, tout était parfait, encore merci."

The bedroom was very comfortabable and extremely quiet with the bathroom nextdoor. We really enjoyed our stay and started and ended each day on the sunny rooftop with a stunning view. Guillaume is very welcoming and friendly. He responded promptly on our mail, made us feel at home on arrival and had nice suggestions for diner etc. The apartment was well equipped and very clean and light. We loved our stay and highly recommend both the apartment and Guillaume&friends.
Fantastic apartment in the heart of Paris. With the central location, we walked to most of our destinations, though the options of transport are plentiful. Guillaume is very welcoming and friendly. He responded to enquiries and correspondence promptly. He made us feel at home on arrival and was there to meet us to ensure we were comfortable. The apartment was well equipped and very clean and light. We loved our stay and highly recommend both the apartment and your delightful host. We will be back for sure...:)
How lovely time in the very heart of Paris! What a great location, and very cozy home. Also Guillaume, he is very kind and nice! Thank you so much to Guillaume and his friends!
Appartement sympa et chambre calme ! Proche de toutes les commodités, en plein centre de Paris. Je ne regrette pas mon choix :-) De plus, Guillaume est une personne très agréable. J'ai beaucoup apprécié nos échanges. Une adresse à garder dans mes notes !
I am very happy to be the first one to leave feedback for this apt. We are two girls in our 30th, came to Paris for shopping and sightseeing. This apt locates in the center of Paris, really easy walk to Chatelet station, really easy to take subway to any place in Paris. There are hundreds of restaurants, bars, and carrefour in my neighborhood. At the beginning, I was worried for the noise from bars to bother my sleep, however, the crowd died down after 11-12pm. It's not a problem. It's in the center of Paris, just walking distance to Louvre, toulleries garden, pont des arts, and many others, we enjoy a morning run from this apt all the way to concord and back. There are all basic housekeeping stuff in the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom, very clean, comfortable beds. There are 2 bedrooms with queen size bed individually, a huge sofa bed on the living room (additional sheet and cover in the living room), can easily fit in 5 people. All the TV, DVD, sound system are very high-end and modern. The security is this building is very good, there are 2 locks in the first floor, one is PIN number and one is censor key. I feel very safe in this apt. There's a elevator that can fit 2 people and 2 luggages, convenient!! Lovely balcony view of the busy street. I would strongly recommend others to stay here for your visit to Paris.
El departamento de Guillaume es fantástico, está muy bien emplazado, se puede ir a muchos sitios interesantes caminando, es amplio, luminoso, ¡que bueno que tiene elevador! tiene una muy buena vista de Sebastopol, fueron muy amables, todo muy bien. Si vienes en un grupo de 4 personas estarás muy cómodo, desayunado con el sol que entra por el balcón, tienes tv, radio, wifi, super bien, y buena calefacción para el invierno.
Appartement parfait, très agréable à vivre et parfaitement situé. Une adresse à recommander sans hésitation. Guillaume a été très disponible, serviable, l'accueil était parfait et les informations pratiques toutes disponibles !
I know Guillaume for over 5 years, he is absolutely charming, respectful, kind, honest. He will be perfect host because he knows Paris very well, he will be able to recommend places if you are here to visit. His apartment is well located. You will feel at ease in a comfortable place. If you want to host him, he is respectful, fun, and smart with a lot of humor, always into have a good chat. Je connais Guillaume depuis plus de 5 ans, il est absolument charmant, respectueux, gentil, honnête. Il sera l'hôte parfait parce qu'il connait très bien Paris, il sera en mesure de recommander des endroits si vous êtes ici pour visiter. Son appartement est bien situé. Vous vous sentirez à l'aise dans un endroit confortable. Si vous voulez de l'accueillir, il est respectueux, amusant, intelligent avec beaucoup d'humour et toujours partant pour une bonne conversation.
Guillaume est un de mes meilleurs amis, son appartement est toujours propre et rangé. C'est un appartement typiquement parisien, idéal pour un séjour à Paris. Son quartier est très sympa et le parc Montsouris est magnifique, très pratique pour un petit jogging matinal. Très bien desservi par les transports en commun, et plein de places de stationnement à proximités."

Check in and out was easy and hassle free. Minus Neighbours were quite noisy during my stay. Quite steep stairs which could be tricky for people with lots of luggage or mobility problems. It would be good to provide some directions to the flat from the nearest metro station. Overall a great stay and I would definitely recommend the apartment for a short stay in Paris.
Easy check in and check out. Great communication from the host. The decoration of the apartment has changed slightly since the photos, the nice wallpaper has gone and the TV is now mounted on the wall but other than that it was exactly as described.
Great central location. Check-in and out was smooth with no issues.
This flat has perfect location, if you love night life. lots of bars, restaurants are just at your door. the room condition is very clean and comfortable.
Great location - easy walk to Metro stop and close to the Louvre!! Also very detailed and easy clean-in instructions. Great place for 2 people visiting Paris!
Patrick's flat is really, really good, especially the location! Right in the heart of the city, there are loads of bars and cafes nearby. You can go to tourist features like Notre Dame and the Louvre by feet within just a few minutes. If I go back to Paris again, I would be glad to stay there again! I'm totally satisfied.
Stayed in March 2014. The location is by far the best I have stayed at (close to metro, shopping and restaurants right outside the apartment), however, with location, it usually comes with more noise. The first night that we were there, there were some guys playing what I think to be Rock Band or DDR and they probably had their window open so we can hear them all night long yelling and screaming from the courtyard. I finally fell asleep at 2am but my husband said they continued until much later. It only happened on the first night though (on a weekend) and I am a deep sleeper, once I fall asleep, nothing will wake me up, so it didn't really bother me that much. I cooked at the apartment and while nice that it was provided, but the pots and pans provided were realllllllly worn out. Check in and check out was really easy.
Apartment was in an incredible location. Close to may things you'd want to see in Paris. Easy walk to Notre Dame, Pompidou, Louvre, etc... It was also right next to a delicious crepe vendor. :) The apartment was perfect for 2 of us for a couple of nights. The toilet is outside of the studio but it was private and right next to the studio. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a rock and the shower was nice and warm with great water pressure. :) Never got a chance to meet Patrick in person and his detailed instructions on how to get into the apartment were very easy. Thanks Patrick!
Small, but fine. And most importantly, great location! Nice street with jazz and live music bars, and the good thing is that you don't hear the noise within the apartment. Lively neighbourhood with lots of restaurants and on walking distance from a lot of sights. The contact with the owner was good and everything was arranged smoothly.
The location of the apartment was fantastic. We were able to walk to Pompidou from there. Also there were several very gd restaurants around the corner from the apartment. Although, the apartment isn't very big, and the toilet is outside, it is a fair trade-off for the convenience.
Even though I did not meet Patrick personally, he promptly and courteously answered all emails. The apartment was exactly as described; it was clean and ready for occupancy at time of check-in. The location was excellent! It was convenient to either walk or take the metro to everywhere in central Paris. There was a bit of noise at night due to the restaurants on the ground level, but when the windows are shut, it decreased the noise level. I am a bit concerned regarding the stairs. It was easy enough to climb up and down, but a heavy suitcase would have made it difficult. In spite of this, everything else is ideal.
Merci à Patrick d'avoir mis à disposition son appartement qui était très propre et bien entretenu. Le principal avantage était l'emplacement : vraiment centré et bien placé.
The apartment has a very very central location, 100 meters from Chatelet station, which connects you anywhere in Paris very easily. There are plenty of bars, restaurants and supermarket nearby (Monoprix). The property is just as seen in the pictures, very clean and comfortable, good size for Paris, with good kitchen and bathroom. The sofabed is also very good. Even though it is said to be in the 2nd floor, it's in the 3rd floor and the stairs can be tricky with suitcases. Still worth the effort I must say. We never met Patrick in person, and check-in/check-out process are kind of automatic, which is very good and worked very well in my opinion. I strongly recommend this apartment!
Patrick was very informative from point of booking all the way up to and including our stay. Instructions clear and easy to use. Apartment was perfect for me and my parents, with a separator to add extra privacy to the bedrooms. Area full of night life, including many free jazz bands playing in local bars. We only used the metro to get to the station and back as due to central location we walked everywhere else (Louvre, Musee D'Orsay, Champs Élysées, Notee Dame). Will use again next time I visit :)
Patrick ha sido muy eficiente, resolvió inmediatamente pequeños problemas no vinculados al departamento. El lugar es excepcional, conectado con todo París, fundamentalmente con el metro y el rer (lo que mas utilizamos). A 200 mts. hay un supermercado con todo lo que necesites. En los alrededores cientos de lugares para comer, beber y para comprar comidas para llevar. El departamento es cómodo para cuatro personas, con un buen baño y cocina equipada convenientemente. La heladera no tiene freezer pero sirve para lo básico. El wi fi y la tv, funcionaron perfectamente. La relación precio-calidad-ubicación es muy buena. Considero que es recomendable.
The apartment: The apartment was as advertized. Was well kept and clean. Met our needs well. Ideal for 2 adults. A little tight for 4. Patrick was very responsive to all our queries and the instructions to get into the apartment were spot on. Finding the door to the building proved a little tricky due to the cafe's on either side. The apartment has a washing machine which proved very useful. Note that the apartment is up a pretty narrow flight of stairs and there is no elevator. So carrying the luggage up could be a problem. We traveled relatively light (only cabin bags) so it was not a major problem. Location: Excellent!!! Couldn't have asked for a better one for the price. Literally minutes on foot from the RER and Metro lines. None of the major historic attractions are more than 15 mins away. Louvre can be walked to. We were traveling with 2 kids and my mom (65 yrs) and had no problem using the public transport. There are literally dozens of restaurants and bars to choose from. There is also a mini-mart 2 mins away which stocks pretty much everything you'd need to cook and clean. Would certainly recommend this as a place to stay in Paris.
The apartment was clean and lovely,I think perfect for two person,very central position with lot of market,restaurant and pub. The metro is really near and we take it every morning, not before having had breakfast with pain au chocolat! but you can walk everywhere due to the good position (louvre,operà ecc). The apartment is up a pretty narrow flight of stairs and there is no elevator but it wasn't a problem for us 'cos we had cabin bags!tv and wifi ok!Patrick was really kind and responsive to all our queries and the instructions to get into the apartment were spot on.Perfect for a short -lasting travel!
We had a delightful stay at the apartment. The location simply could not be beat. Within walking distance of the Louvre, Notre-Dame, restaurants, bars, shops...it was wonderful. It was very comfortable and clean, and Patrick left excellent instructions for us. It all went as planned. Guests need to be aware that it is 53 steps up a winding staircase to the apartment. But since we only had to bring our bags up and down once, it was not a problem. Because of the location, there is some street noise at night, to be expected in this neighborhood. It did not bother us. I would highly recommend the apartment and Patrick to any visitors! We took the RER from the airport and our metro station was one block away.
Great location, perfect size for a weekend in Paris. The apartment was exactly like the photos. Clean and modern. Towels were quite shabby though, so you may want to bring your own. Also, there is no bed linen kept in the flat, the cleaner brings bedding on the day you arrive, so make sure you give the exact number of persons staying. We had a last minute change and one more person came along, and despite texting and calling patrick, no bedding arrived for the spare bed, and so we had to taxi all over paris on Friday night to buy sheets, duvet cover and pillow cover which we left in the flat. Despite that, the accommodation was fine and I recommend the apartment.
Four of us stayed for 4 nights. It is a lovely apartment (email hidden)ly central area. Patrick's instructions were very clear and we had no problems letting ourselves in. A little noisy on the weekends as there are a few bars around but it is to be expected in a busy area. Thank you Patrick - we really enjoyed our stay. Kerry"

It was well equipped and a pretty decent size for a Paris apartment. The bathroom was very nice and clean too but we wish it had better ventilation. Mini kitchen was very well equipped and the bed was comfortable. We were let in by the cleaner at about 1 pm but she was still cleaning and told us to return in about an hour and a half.
Brilliant little flat with everything we needed. Danielle couldn't have been more helpful. Highly recommend!
We loved Paris and our little studio! Very clean. The position was the best, and the neighbourhood was one of our favourite. It is really 5 minutes walk from Pompidou, 10 minutes from Louvre etc. Even if we didn't meet Danielle we can say she is lovley and more important very serious. She always responded fast to all our questions. She is very well prepared. We recommend Danielle and her studio! Thank you, Danielle!
Great and clean small studio apartment in an excellent area of Paris. Tons of restaurants and bars right around the apartment and it's easy to get anywhere you want via the nearby subway lines. Would stay here again. Highly recommended.
I had such a pleasant stay at Danielle's studio- it is sweet and charming! The location is great with restaurants, cafes even a grocery near by. It was no problem getting to the airport from the Metro located around the corner.A quick walk to the Louvre and the Centre Pompidou were my highlights. Danielle was very responsive and the lady exchanging the key with me was very nice and helpful as well. There are maps and restaurant recommendations in the studio. You will feel right at home. A great host. I will be back : ) Thanks Danielle
sehr nett!
We had a wonderful stay in Paris at Danielle's charming and beautiful flat!! My sister and I were fortunate enough to meet Danielle on the first day of our visit. She went out of her way to assist us with restaurants and even guided us to the Lourve and gave us added insight on her amazing city. The flat is exactly as pictured. It was clean and well stocked with many extras such as a bottle opener and wine glasses. Danielle provided very informative guides to the products in her flat. We arrived early and were able to keep our things in the flat while we walked around. Her housekeeper was also incredibly sweet. I have no negative things to say about my experience staying in Paris at Danielle's flat. In fact if I'm ever in Paris again I will definitely be looking this flat up! Very, very high recommendation!!
Very nice, cosy place. Perfect location.
Danielle's apartments has everything you need for romantic holidays in Paris. It's located at the center of Paris near of all attractions. You can reach Louvre in 15 minutes by foot. We highly recommend this apartments!
Thanx to Danielle, wonderful host, great place, perfect location."

It was our first time using airbnb and it was one of the most satisfying holiday experiences ever. Both Matthieu and Alice were very helpful with tips,advice and answering any questions we had, but we didn't really need to ask anything as they had kindly explained and prepared all the information already. The flat is perfect for a couple, very clean and modern and is situated within walking distance of everywhere we wanted to go or at least a Metro station to get there . Would definitely use their flat again. Thanks Matthieu and Alice James and Hollie X
My girlfriend and I had a great time in Paris, the apartment was perfect for our city-trip. In the middle of the centre. Well styled and organised. You guys seriously did a well job fixing and decorating the apartment! We were welcomed by a helpful friend of Matthieu, she showed us around. It included everything we needed. informative handbook of things closeby and with tips for transportation. Breakfast in bed enjoying the view of the building across the street. Being used to cycling in big city's, We loved taking the handy Velib bikes to cycle to all the nice area's, Great Idea!! The table was a funny invention! Loved the apartment and Loved Paris! Thanks Mathhieu & Alice! à bientôt!! Ray & Liselotte
I stayed in this lovely apartment with my boyfriend for 4 nights and was completely satisfied throughout my Paris visit. It is brand new, its size is perfect for 2 persons, the bed is very comfortable and has everything one might need during a short stay. The location is also good, within walking distance to all major attractions of Paris. Initially I was slightly concerned about the area but actually never felt unsafe when walking home late at night on St Denis street. I recommend this apartment and would definitely return when I'm back in Paris!
Alice and Matthieu's apartment is gorgeous, truly a gem within Paris. The location is great, right off rue Montorgueil and near the subway (Chatelet is less than 10 min. walk). The house itself is very stylish, spacious, clean, with a lot of natural light. The bed was super comfortable and the bath and shower were fantastic. The apartment is also equipped with everything you could need, and it is a very important plus (extra towels, extra pillows, umbrella, shower gel and shampoo...). Alice and Matthieu are excellent hosts, always available to answer our questions or to give us some good tips about Paris. Alice has also a lovely blog on Paris where you can find a lot of interesting """"off the beaten path"""" things to do. I can't think of any other way we could have a better stay! Highly, highly recommended!
Myself and my boyfriend stayed at Matth and Alice's apartment for 4 nights and can not recommend it more! Their regular communication and advise prior to our trip was beyond helpful, as was Alice's excellent Blog on Paris. The apartment itself is situated in an extremely central area, was spotless and was the ideal Parisian stay. The shower was amazing, as was the bed and the style of the apartment is gorgeous. We could not have asked for more and had the perfect trip! Thanks you Matth and Alice xx
Perfectly located, very nice newly finished apartment with a modern style. Very well equipped, you will find everything you need. The apartment is finished in every single details and the space exploit in a very efficient way. Matth and Alice were always available for me and gave me great advice about the area; I also loved their guest handbook! Definitely an amazing stay! Looking forward to my next trip to Paris :)
I really enjoyed staying at Matth & Alice's place, this is a very stylish apartment, brand new, with all needed equipments and in a great location; just perfect!! Matth and Alice were also very welcoming hosts and always available to answer my questions or for good tips about Paris. Thanks also guys for your very handy """"Guest booklet"""". It really guided me throughout my stay. I highly recommend this apartment, which will be my first choice next time I stop by Paris!
I rented Matthieu's flat during the last week of January. The location is great, close to Reaumur Sebastopol and nice restaurants & bars. The flat is a studio (1bedroom) but amazingly arranged. The room is so great, the bed is marvellous. The great thing about the flat is the bathroom : a very large bathroom with a kind of Italian shower ! I loved it ! I did not met directly Matthieu but was welcomed by one of his friend. She gave me all the infos (keys, Wi-Fi, places to buy food). I highly recommend it !
L'appartement d'Alice et Matthieu est tout simplement parfait. On s'y sent tout de suite à la maison, tout y est à la fois pratique, beau et confortable. Je regrette déjà que mon séjour à Paris ait été si court. Le lit est un vrai bonheur et on aimerait ne jamais devoir se lever. Le quartier est sympa et offre une très large game de services et d'activités. Communication excellente avec les propriétaires et leur contact sur place. Définitivement ma prochaine adresse à Paris."

Angela was not met, but no problem. The rooms are exactly the photos and had seemed too good duahdeul. 4 people life was sufficient for the problem did not occur. Rooms around the Mart, Metro, buses have stretched well gave a more comfortable life. Then go to Paris again this will be where we want to stay at the same place.
Very nice apartment, small but clean and cute for 3 with a 5 years old baby. The location is perfect , i the heart of Paris. I wish to come back soon. The host has been very nice with us , everything was clear and easy.
This apartment is in an amazing location with the best restaurants and food markets surrounding it. The place is small but has everything you could need. I would book this apartment again in a heartbeat.Thanks for having us!
The experience with the host was great... Mr. Avond explained how to get to the apartment and waited for us....apartment was cozy and on a great (email hidden)ally great (email hidden)e internet did not work for the first day, but Mr. Avond gave us another code that worked.
The host was lovely! However the appartment was just adequate. We expected to arrive to a warming home, with a freshly made bed. Instead we arrived to a cold studio, with old tatty sheets laid next to the bed ready for us to make. Also once we had made the bed there was just a single duvet floating around inside a double duvet cover, not ideal. I also think it wouldn't go a miss for the host to invest in some new pillows I'm not fussy but these were very bad. The overall stay was good, amazing location! I just expected a little more effort to be put into the room. The kitchen was okay but I did feel the need to clean all cutlery before use, and when I asked if there was any washing liquid to do so, I was told that would not be provided. Over all rating...average.
We didn't actually meet our hosts as they were (website hidden) would have been easier for us if we had had clear instructions about accessing our apartment prior to arrival in Paris but there was no significant delay.The apartment was simple and fully equipped.Wonderful location and perfect for our three days in Paris.We had a fantastic time and would go back to that apartment and area again.Thank you.
Perfect location in Paris! Many cafes, little shops, beautiful and famous sightseeing places around. E.g. the oldest bakery in Paris (Stohrer) is just around the corner, metro station and Louvre museum - only 15 min. away by foot. Apartment is really small, but totally fine for 2-4 persons staying in Paris for a few days. Even though we did not meet Angela, everything was fine, because we knew a door code and where to find a key, so entering the apartment was not a problem. A suggestion for those who are planing to stay in this apartment - ask Angela for all details and instructions how to enter the apartmet before coming to Paris, then you will not face any difficulties and will definitely enjoy your stay :)
My friend and I stayed at Angelas apartment in December. The apartment was nice and clean. You could not ask for a better location in Paris. There is a street market and a subway stop less than a block away.
Great location, close to metro and Louvre Museum. The apartment is small, but we had everything we needed. Very good for a short stay in Paris. The hosts were very friendly. We would recommend this apartment.
My family stayed for 4 days in November. Nice place to be in with little shops everywhere from cafés to restaurants to small supermarket. Walking around Paris is nice and wonderful!.Manage to have small talk with Parisians with directions without any problems as I don't speak French. Wifi is good as well. Hope to visit Paris again and definitely will take up Angela's again.
Très bonne situation à deux pas du Sacré Coeur. L'appartement se situe dans une rue calme, proche de toutes commodités. Le logement est agréable. Bonne communication avec le propriétaire.
Locatie mooi. Appartement klein, maar alles voorhanden. Fijne douche. Wc reparatie was handig geweest ivm waterverspilling en lawaai. Minpunt: Maar twee handdoeken voor vier dagen, want 1 was erg vies en 1 vd 2 die wel schoon waren heel mini. Ontvangst door verhuurder was prima.
Stayed here for two nights in April 2014. Very good location, close to Sacre Coeur and to Metro Station. Apartment is basic but nice. I would come back!
Great location! Very happy with the place, looked exactly like on the pictures. Thanks Angela!
L'appartement est très bien situé tout proche de la basilique mais à l'écart de la foule. Les photo's donnent une impression exacte de l'intérieur. J'y étais seul et je passais mes jours ailleurs. Je peux m'imaginer que l'espace est restreinte pour passer des heures à plusieurs, mais ce n'est pas pour cela qu'on vient à Paris. Je n'ai pas eu l'occasion de voir la locatrice, mais la communcation se passait sans problèmes.
Le logement est particulièrement bien situé ,dans une rue très calme de Montmartre. Je n'ai pas vu mon hôte mais tout a été très respecté( horaire de remise des clefs ,appel téléphonique de l'hôte pour vérifier que tout était OK...) J'aurais aimé qu'il y ait au moins un paquet de café ( il y avait des filtres et la cafetière )pour le matin.
Le logement est tout à fait fidèle aux photos, très fonctionnel et très calme. La station Miromesnil est à deux pas. L'hôte est tout à fait arrangeant pour la récupération des clés.
Tutto perfetto, precisi puntuali educati l'appartamento e' comodo per visitare la citta e' pulito e ordinato
Petit logement très correct au calme situé dans un quartier huppé."

Walking distance to all public transport which is perfect for sight seeing! The apartment fitted four people comfortably with the pull out couch being extremely comfortable! The toilet was quite entertaining, might be difficult if you are tall. However over all a fantastic, clean and convenient apartment to stay in, whilst visiting Paris! Highly recommended.
A fantastic place in the heart of Paris! Nicolas keeps place really clean and welcoming for the guests. You can walk to pretty much all the tourist attractions from his place. We had a great stay (family of three) this Spring!
We could not have had a better experience. The apartment itself is lovely, the location is fantastic (walking distance to most attractions), and Nicolas is a fantastic host who truly cares that his guests have a good experience in his city. Highly recommended!
Nicolas's place is very lovely just as the photos show on the web. Location is so good we go anywhere by metro just take few mins walk. Many restaurants, shops and cafes in this area. Must be our best choice in Paris. Thank you, Nicolas.
The apartment is just like in the pictures: clean and very well equipped; and our family (2 adults and 2 teenagers) were very pleased with it (with the small toilet and all!). All beds were very comfortable, and the heating and everything else worked just fine. Nicolas is very friendly and helpful. He explained everything in the apartment and also provided tips regarding the neighborhood. He also let us leave our luggage for some time more on our checking out, allowing some final sightseeing or Paris, while he prepared the apartment for the next guest. Like everyone else mentions, the apartment is extremely well located, with many tourist attractions at walking distance, and providing easy access to metro, train stations and airports. We definitely recommend Nicolas´s place.
We loved our stay in this apartment! Nicolas was a wonderful host. We had plenty of room (there were two of us) and the apartment was very clean. Nicolas even allowed us to check in early as we had an early flight. The best thing about the apartment is that we were in walking distance to every single site we wanted to see in Paris, and loved getting to know the city by foot. The apartment is also very close to the metro which made travel to/from the airport easy/convenient. The only thing to mention would be that the toilet room is quite small, but we had read than in prior reviews and it really didn't matter.
Замечательная квартира-студия в отличном месте: Centre G.Pompidou - за углом. Rue de Rivoli, Louvre, Notre-Dame, Tour St-Jacques, Hotel De Ville - все рядом, все пешком! Помимо прочего, мы посещали выставку Maison&Objet: от дома 5 минут пешком до линии RER, которая идет прямо до выставки - очень удобно. Множество магазинчиков и кафешек вокруг дома не дадут скучать, особенно вечерами по пятницам и субботам, когда парижане расслабляются после трудовой недели :) Благодаря стараниям Николя, квартира очень чистая и приятная, несмотря на плотный график жильцов. Николя по-настоящему ответственный и старательный хозяин, моментально отвечает на письма и запросы. В квартире все продумано и сделано для удобства проживания, есть все необходимое оборудование в кухне, очень удобные спальные места, техника прекрасно работает. Туалет и правда оказался маленьким, зато с забавным дизайном! ))) Николя, большое спасибо за Вашу заботу! Мы очень рады нашему знакомству и с удовольствием приехали бы к Вам еще! Надеемся снова встретиться, Наталья, Татьяна, Марина --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Wonderful studio apartment in a great location: Centre Pompidou is around the corner. Rue de Rivoli, Louvre, Notre-Dame, Tour St-Jacques, Hotel De Ville - all nearby, all in walking distance! We visited the exhibition Maison&Objet: from home 5 minutes to walk to the RER line that goes straight to the show - it was very convenient. Many shops and cafes around the house will not be bored, especially on Friday nights and Saturdays, when Parisians relax after the working week :) Thanks to the efforts of Nicolas, the apartment is very clean and pleasant, despite the tight schedule of tenants. Nicolas is really responsible and diligent host, he immediately responds to letters and requests. The apartment is all thought out and made for the convenience of living, there is have all necessary equipment in the kitchen, very comfortable beds, all equipment works fine. Toilet is really small, but with a funny design! ))) Nicolas, thank you for your care! We are very pleased to meet you and would be happy to come to you again! Hope to see, Natalia, Tatiana, Marina
Amazing apartment. Relly good position, perfect for us and our needs.
Very nice apt, only the toilet is too small, the location is great! but there is a night life until late right under the window, which may be a problem if you want to sleep around 10/11pm, specially if you have kids with you. The host was very correct and helpful, but had no tolerance and did not accept apologies after the mess a family of 4, with 2 kids left in the apt after leaving, because both parents were really sick at the end. So do not leave any mess there ;)
If you're looking for the perfect apartment (email hidden)ly and central location, this is the one. We had an absolutely outstanding time at Nicolas's apartment in Les Marais. The apartment is just nextdoor to the Pompidou (modern art museum) and walking distance to tons of restaurants, the Notre Dame, the Louvre, and more. We couldn't have been happier with our stay! Nicolas was very easy to meet up with and was very helpful showing us around the apartment. He was flexible with our arrival time and everything went very smoothly. The apartment itself is beautiful and very modern. Nicolas keeps very good care of it and it shows. Bed is comfortable. Bathroom is clean. Washer/dryer and iron/ironing board were also very convenient. The furniture was also very beautiful.
Nossa experiência no studio Le Coq Heron foi totalmente positiva. O studio é simples, mas é bem localizado e tem tudo que precisa para passar uma temporada em Paris. Agradável! Próximo ao studio tem farmácia, supermercado, bons bares e restaurantes,.além de uma loja de doces e pães deliciosos!
Excellent accueil et appartement très bien placé. Nicolas est très sympathique, serviable et flexible pour les horaires d'arrivée comme de départ. L'appartement est très bien situé, très fonctionnel pour 2 personnes. Situé en plein centre de Paris, il est à 2 pas de toutes les activités parisiennes. Vraiment parfait. C'était ma première expérience Airbnb et je ne suis vraiment pas déçu. Je recommande fortement
My sister and I stayed at Nicolas' place for 4 days, and had a great stay. All pictures were very representative of the cozy apartment, and it's in a great neighborhood with Metro access not too far. We loved our stay!
El studio está muy buen ubicado y equipado. Cerca de todo.
Great apartment, neighbourhood. Enjoyable experience.
The unit was simply amazing. It is exactly the way described on the website. It's very clean just a step outside of an apartment numerous cafes and restaurants were available. It was located in the heart of Paris. Closest metro station is a minute away, also the station connects to every metro line in Paris. Unit was very clean and it was more than what we could ask for. Plus Nicolas is almost fluent in English and he responded our question really really fast. This place/manager deserves 5 stars. Thank You !
Месторасположение-отличное, самый центр, все красоты в шаговой доступности, обошли всё пешком. Квартира удобная и уютная, правда немого пошарпаная, но это не портило общего впечатления, большой плюс-магазин прямо напротив.
Super petit studio bien équipé et très bien placé dans Paris , situation très centrale; le studio est tres calme car donne sur une cour , donc on dort bien apres les longues journées de marche dans Paris , merci Nicolas de nous avoir accueilli tard !!!
Nicolas flat is a really nice place located right next to the Centre Pompidou where is very convenient to walk to La Seine, Notre Dame, Lourve, Marais... Just need to walk up one stair to the flat. A very well equipped unit and we have a very comfortable stay here.
It was really great studio. I feel very comfortable and cozy. Nicolas was very kind. Location is also good. Thank you. 숙소 위치가 메트로의 중심인 샤틀레 역과 가까워 매우 편리했구요, 샤를드골 공항에서 RER로 한번에 갈 수 있어서 좋았습니다. 지도상에서는 퐁피두 센터랑 조금 떨어져 있어 보이는데 바로 퐁피두 센터가 있는 쪽 아래 골목에 있어서 매우 편리했어요. 택시를 타거나 해도 퐁피두 센터로 가달라고 하면 되고 숙소찾을때도 퐁피두 센터 방향으로 가면 됩니다. 바로 앞 골목에 10시까지 하는 마트가 2개나 있고 아침에 일찍 문여는 카페도 있어서 아침도 일찍 사먹고 좋았어요. 밤에는 앞쪽에 테라스 있는 가게들에서 맥주마시는 사람들이 많았는데 다들 현지인 같아 보였지만 밤 늦게 다니는 건 조금 위험해 보이는 듯 했어요. 화장실 물도 잘나오고 주방 기구들도 훌륭했고, 무엇보다 니콜라스가 영어를 잘해서 처음에 친절하게 다 설명해주고 좋았어요. 마지막에 체크아웃할때는 열쇠를 앞집 문에 넣으라고해서 넣고 왔습니다. 침대도 정말 편했고, 드라이기도 좋고, 아 슬리퍼를 가져가시면 안에서 신으시기 좋을것 같아요. 파리 돌아다니기에 부족함 없이 완벽한 숙소였습니다.^^"

While it is small everything was set up to be efficent. Lots of room to unpack On a wonderful pedestrian street - young neighborhood. Cheese shops, wine shops, butcher, poultry and fish stores in the same block if you want to cook if not there are loads of charming cafes and restaurants. Subway is a couple blocks. Walk to Notre Dam in 10 minutes and the Louvre in 15. Only drawback was steep stairs. Not good if you have mobility problems. Good if you plan on eating that extra croissant. Jul was very pleasant and helpful We would stay again
Jul advertises """"Best Deal.. heart of Paris"""" -and he is absolutely right! I cannot imagine a better location, rate or host. The apartment is exactly as described - spotless, comfortable and attractive. Just around the corner is a wonderful array of fabulous neighborhood restaurants and shops with incredible pastries, breads and cheeses - truly the local flavor of Paris steps away from your door. Jul was very kind and provided terrific advice on things to do. In fact, for our first Paris visit we found everyone to be warm and helpful. With Les Halles a short walk and Velib bike stations so nearby (which I highly recommend) you can be anywhere in no time. Jul, his wonderful accommodations and hospitality made our vacation a truly memorable one. If you want to be central to everything and enjoy wonderful, affordable accommodations - this is your place!
Jul was a great host, he was nice enough to stay up and meet us late in the night when our train came in. The apartment was exactly what we were hoping for, a great location to really get a feel for what life in Paris is like. It was great fun to get up and walk a few steps in the morning and have tons of bakery's and food options, shops and very vibrant atmosphere. The apartment itself was in great working order, a bit of a trek up a narrow spiral staircase, probably 4th floor, and it was dark at night, no lights in the stairway. At night there was a bit of noise, but my wife is a light sleeper and it didn't bother her, so no worries there. Overall a fantastic experience, we highly recommend it. Thanks Jul
Very nice place, and very central!
This was the first time ever that I was using Airbnb and I have to say that it is a safe and secured website to book apartments and I was extremely pleased with the process and the outcome.I know Paris quite well because my mum is french so I do travel to Paris at least twice a year and the Center is always my first choice to stay.Everything went very well with the booking from start to finish. Jul is a very friendly, helpful and easy going guy, he makes you feel comfortable straight away.The apartment was clean, spacious and the location is the best that I have ever stayed in Paris...close to all amenities, the best restaurants and bars and just 2 minutes walk from Sentier metro station.You could not ask for more to be honest. I was traveling on my own from London with Eurostar and Gare Du Nord is only a few minutes away to reach the apartment by metro approximately 20/25mns.I have previously stayed in different apartments while visiting Paris in the past but this apartment does not compare and it is definitely worth the asking price although I was on my own, it could have been even better if i had to share and split the cost but this was not the case and I am not complaining.I felt totally safe there at night. I am a tall guy so I was wondering if I would be able to stand in the mezzanine upstairs but it is massive much bigger than it looks like on the pictures. It can be a little bit noisy at nights because it is one of the busiest place in Paris but again I liked it,to hear people buzzing around and it did not matter to me at all because it was part of my (email hidden)e Wifi is fast and I did not experience any problems at all with the connection during my 6 days stay.This place will be convenient if you are traveling on your own, as a couple or 3 people and maybe 4.You will certainly have enough space.The apartment has everything that you will find in your own place.I cannot find any negative comments to make about Jul's apartment to be honest because I have travelled all over the world with my job and stayed in numerous places so I could tell when something is in need of improvements or not.I would definitely recommend Jul's apartment to anyone traveling to Paris either for the first time or not and looking to stay in a great and fantastic location where you cannot get it wrong.If you can afford it and if you do not want to get disappointed elsewhere, just do not hesitate, trust me, book this place and you will have a wonderful experience of the city.This apartment is now my number one choice.Many thanks for everything Jul and I hope to see you soon again!Take care (email hidden)eddy
very nice appartment , we liked it very much.The quartier is as well beautifull.The contact with Jul was very nice.We will come back.
I loved the apartment, just perfect. It's near metro, restaurant, supermarket, and the neighborhood is calm. Jul was very attentive. My next time in Paris I will be there again.
Cute apartment in the heart of Paris. Everything is close by; Metro, resto, supermarkets and entertainment. Montorgueil is the place to be! The host is wonderful and very helpful and accommodating. I recommend this place to newcomers or road travelers.
Fantastic apartment. Communication with Jul and Beverly was great as well. The apartment is super cute and in the perfect area. I can't recommend enough. Merci!
We LOVED the place ! Just perfect! -quiet -small but perfectly organized -we slept great bed is nice and comfy -the place has everything you need -we love the street and location We will come back:-)
Appartement très bien situé, calme et bien équipé!
We enjoyed our stay at Jul's. It's a great location!
This apartment was comfortable and very convenient to most everything. It was a very short walk to the train station as well. It was nice to be able to have a leisure coffee in the morning in the apartment before beginning the day. Would definitely recommend !
my compliments to Jul and his flat: it is cozy and comfortable, clean and really really charming, colorful and enjoyable. The location is ideal to visit the city center, the apartment is quiet and located (email hidden)ly district. I advise those who want to spend a few great days in Paris to contact Jul - to whom i send many many thanks
We loved staying with Jul! His place is very homey, warm and cozy. Loved that it was on ground level for all our luggage, he met us there on the day that we arrived and was a gracious host the whole time. We would stay here again for sure. Thank you Jul for giving us a great time in Paris!
Had a 5 day stay in Jul's apartment with my family and it was everything the listing promised. Clean, relatively quiet (considering the busy district), all the linen / cooking supplies you could need and with a bevy of good Parisian eateries and bistros all within a stone's throw. Great for one or two people, it was a little cramped with our 8 year old too, but we managed. The 10th arr. is a very central location, just far enough from the hustle and bustle of the river districts, and with a quaint charm all its own. T he hirebikes or metro being the best way to explore the city from Jul's apartment. I would stay again, no worries. Thanks Jul!
Sublim beliggenhed og velfungerende aftale med hensyn til adgang. Sobert rent og hyggeligt. Kunne ikke være bedre Velegnet også hvis man har børn, da der er 5 sovepladser med WiFi og fladskærm, så der er mulighed (email hidden) mellem turene. Kan stærkt anbefales.
What a cool apartment! It is cozy and quiet. And in the middle of Paris. We loved to stay here. With 4 persons, the space is just enough. Fully equipped with everything you need. It feels like home. We will definitely return if we visit Paris again.
Had a great time in Jul's flat. Good directions, host was communicative, and great location.
Merci. Très chouette appart très bonne situation."

Everything has been perfectly clean, Linen and towels were fresh, kitchen well equiped and Eric has been super nice and very helpfull with all kinds of questions. The location of this place is great - Notre Dame, Pont Neuf - all in walking distance! I can absolutely recommend this place!
Eric's apartment is in a nice central location to shops & major attractions but quiet enough to have a good night's sleep. It's within walking distance to 3 metro stations, one of which is the """"super interchange"""" of Châtelet Les Halles with many metro lines stopping there as well as the RER lines for Disneyland, Vicennes and Fontainebleau. Extremely convenient to get around from the apt. The apt was clean, comfortable, had a fresh coat of paint & strong enough hot water pressure from the shower. Eric was a nice host - he provided guidebooks, maps, and a bottle of wine ☺. Also, he was very fast with his correspondence on email and phone. I'd highly recommend his place to anyone travelling as a single (as I did) or a couple as a good base for exploring central Paris.
Appartement sympathique, équipements très corrects, Loueur à l'écoute et très accueillant, donne et fournis des idées de sorties et visites. parfait pour un couple en villégiature. Quartier proche de beaucoup de centre d'intérêts dans le centre de Paris. Expérience à renouveler.
Eric est très sympathique et répond à toutes vos interrogations. concernant l'appartement en lui même il n'y a pas de surprise, propre et fonctionnel et correspond bien à ce qui est marqué dans l'annonce. Il est proche du métro et du Paris """"à visiter"""" , bref pour des vacanciers comme nous la question ne se pose pas le service est bien mieux que dans un hôtel! Merci encore à Eric pour le petit rosé de bienvenue! Axel
Oh Paris, What is there to say? First Eric was an amazing hosting. When we booked the apartment he gave us all sorts of helpful links to get aquatinted, which was great for me since this was my first trip. The apartment itself is in a great neighborhood. There are some really great spots to eat or drink just on the street a few doors down. The apartment is really quaint. My friend and I had no issue with the apartment at all. The size was perfect for two people. The building is quiet but if you need a little nightlife everything is close by. Eric was a fantastic host and I can't recommend him and his apartment enough. There was a bottle of wine waiting for us when we arrived which was the perfect way to start our trip.
Toilet - abit small Bed - very comfy Location - near to metro Pleasant stay in Paris.
The apartment is in reality a very small (3M by 4M?) efficiency. It has all the amenities, but is so small it's difficult to find a place for your things. It also has the bed up a steep, ladder-like stair that would be a challenge for most older people. It is very quiet and clean on a small side street with a bakery, grocer, small supermarket, cheese shop etc. all within a 3 or 4 minute walk on a cross street. The only reason I marked it down was because of the small space and the loft bed.
Perfect location. Communication was very good and as we had a late flight out, Eric kindly allowed us to stay a little later. Would recommend.
The reservation was canceled 46 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Great location, quiet street situated 50m from Rue Montorgueil, all facilities needed, cafes, restaurants, bars, fresh fruit, bakeries etc. Just a short walk to Sentier or Les Halles metro station to get you on your way around Paris. A lot of the tourist sights within walking distance. Apartment small and quiet, all facilities good. Best sleeps we had on our trip. Doug & Cheryl (NSW Australia)
L'appartement est très bien situé, bien équipé et confortable. On a eu un bon accueil. Très bon séjours à Paris, on recommande !
What a wonderful cosy flat, we loved staying here! So close to the centre- either walking or metro and is near lots of shops, but nice and quiet because it faces a courtyard. Eric was kind and welcoming, sending maps and info over email, meeting us in person (he lives across the hall!) and leaving very helpful guidebooks and maps.
Eric was a nice host, there was not problem with communication, everything was as we arranged. The apartment is beautiful, it is well equipped. What we really like - new shower, wonderful modern lamps. We definitely suggest Eric!
Had an enjoyable stay in Eric's apartment. DIdnt get a chance to meet him but I am sure he would have been as kind and nice as he is in his communications. Great location, modest and cosy apartment. It is fairly clean with everything more than you will need as described, the bath room is fair but a bit small. Close to both the Republique and Temple metro stations, and many local shops, the only one you need is probably Monoprix which is roughly 4 minute walk back on the main street. For me the only minus is that you have to walk up some fairly steep stairs especially if you carry big luggages. I would recommend Eric's flat to any young couple looking for a value stay in Paris!!
This apartment was really perfect for us --- it had everything we needed: a comfortable bed, kitchen, espresso machine, table & chairs, and wifi. It was wonderful to be able to stay in our own studio in such a great neighborhood in Paris. Eric was a great host -- he promptly responded to all of our questions, and went out of his way to inform us about the neighborhood and bring us coffee. I highly recommend this apartment!
Eric's apartment is well-located near République, easy walking distance to the Marais and by chance near two bakeries we had been wanting to try (Du Pain et Des Idées and Poilane). We had a very pleasant 3-day stay. A great location for those exploring Paris.
Eric was a great host for us! Merci beaucoup!
Eric was a wonderful host for our stay in Paris. His apartment is in a great, quiet location right next to several Metro stops. He was very helpful in any questions we had and gave very helpful advice for things to do in Paris. The apartment is clean, and fits 2 peoples comfortably. If travelling on a budget I absolutely recommend this apartment. He even gave us a bottle of wine and guide books to use during our stay. Eric is the best."

He met us on arrival at the apartment and gave us the keys and a tour of the place. The apartment is perfectly situated for tourists. It is in walking distance of everything. I would highly recommend staying at Paco's apartment to everyone.
Paco's apartment is the best place to stay when visiting Paris. The location is great and Paco is a good host. Definitely staying there again when visiting Paris. Thanks Paco!
We had the best time in paco's apt He was so helpful and let us stay in his own apt until the rental was clean as we arrived early. He had breakfast waiting for us. The apt is gorgeous great location quiet for sleeping and best location !!!!!
We stayed in Paco's apt for our anniversary last month and had a fantastic stay. The apartment is beautiful, so clean and has every convenience. The additional touches (nespresso coffee, croissants, water, OJ etc) were just fab and so appreciated after a long journey. Paco was a pleasure to deal with and accommodated us with an early check in and late check out which was hugely appreciated. The 4 flights of stairs were tough at 6 months pregnant, but I would definitely stay here again as its such a great apt and so central. thanks so much Paco!
We stayed in Paco's apartment for a quick 3 day trip. The location was perfect! It completely submerses your stay in the Parisian way of life, that my husband and I fell in love with. The area surrounding the apartment was full of life and there was lots to do and see. Huge plus for there being a Starbucks across the street, and a crepe stand around the corner! The place is just a quick walk to a main metro/RER station (Chatelet and Chatelet-Les Halles) that connects with all other lines, making traveling anywhere in the city super easy. Paco was a great host. We had a late flight in (landed around 10pm) and after we got our bag and figured out where to go to catch the RER, then commuted, we arrived at the apartment around 11:30pm. Paco was very accommodating, and met us with a smile at the apartment despite it being late. He showed us around the apartment and answered all questions we had. Unfortunately, we know little French, and Paco, little English, but we managed to communicate. He made sure we knew that if we had any other questions to just contact him during our stay. The day we checked out we had a later flight in the evening and Paco completely accommodated us! I was worried we would have to drag our bags around town all day, but Paco, without hesitation said we could have the place the entire day until we had to leave for the airport (and at no extra charge)!!!!! Amazing. The apartment was beautiful, just like the pictures! The stairs up to the apartment are a little tight and steep so just make sure your bags aren't too heavy! I was 8 and a half months pregnant during my visit and Paco helped carry my bag up, and made me as comfortable as possible with an extra pillow. It was also a very nice gesture that he provided us with croissants/snack mix and a stocked fridge of refreshments, as well as as much Nespresso as you can drink! Almost everything you need is provided in the apartment (ample amount of towels, toilet paper, umbrella, hairdryer, ironing board/iron, kitchen supplies) which also adds to a carefree stay as not all other BNB places provide this. Merci Beaucoup, Paco! We will definitely come stay again if we come back in the near future!
Paco is a great host. Punctual, kind and very helpful. The Duplex is comfortable, clean, well decorated and its location is strategic! I highly recommend staying there for a wonderful Paris experience...
Paco is a great guy! Our original host cancelled hours before we were due to arrive, and Paco stepped in and saved the day with no fuss. He left work early to meet us, made us feel very welcome and was really flexible about how and when we checked out. His duplex apartment is very well equipped (proper kitchen, quality tv's and entertainment system etc) and perfectly clean, we found the bed very comfortable and he left us a fridge full of water, coke, orange juice and even a bottle of wine. The location is brilliant, within a stone's throw of the Pompidou Centre and yet peaceful, quiet and secure on the 4th floor of a lovely old building, arranged around a shared courtyard. We had a great time there - thank you very much!
I stayed for my work one weekend at his place. I really enjoyed my stay. His apartment is very nice decorated, clean and very comfortable. The location is very central. Paco is very friendly and a good host. I definitely will stay at his place again when I will be in Paris.
This apartment was perfect for our stay and the location is incredible. I can't imagine a better location! Gift shops, cafes, restaurants, groceries, banks, post office, the Metro, and the Pompidou Centre all on your doorstep. Extremely clean, extremely well decorated and appointed, extremely comfortable. The pictures on AirBnB are very accurate when compared to the reality. While the neighbourhood is very lively, the apartment is very quiet. I agree with other reviewers that the stairs are intense, and small bags are recommended. Anyone with mobility or fitness issues will want to look elsewhere. For us, the stairs were only a very small inconvenience when compared to the general wonderfulness of the apartment. We cooked quite a bit during our stay and found we were supplied with all equipment we could have reasonably asked for (although I had packed a chef's knife which we were glad to have brought). We were also grateful for the brand-new washing machine! Paco is absolutely charming and gracious, and he left key supplies for our evening arrival including milk, wine and the fantastic coffee machine and capsules. All the linens and towels you could ask for were also available. And he helped move our bags on arrival and departure, which was extraordinarily generous and much appreciated given those stairs!! A really lovely man, and always quick to respond, even during the Christmas week. He even put up a really cool Christmas tree! We certainly hope to stay again at this fantastic apartment in future.
This apartment was really perfectly located right in the Marais. It was quiet, and although small, had everything we needed for our stay. Thank you Paco!
Excellent Appartement. Paco s'est assuré de mon confort durant tout mon séjour. C'est hôte est très recommandable."

Great apartment in a fantastic, easy to get to location. Very helpful host, highly recommended. Thanks for a wonderful time in Paris Jean François!
We had a great stay in the apartment. Everything was great and very easy to work with Jean-François. We are still thinking about the great pillows on the bed! The apartment is in a great location and was the perfect place to stay for our trip.
Very nice apartment in a nice location. While we did not meet Jean-Francois, we corresponded a number of times during our stay -- always received a prompt response. Once booked the absolute BEST directions you could imagine on getting to and getting into the apartment!!! Very much appreciated. Only one metro stop from Gare du Nord. Very convenient. Great locations with many cafes within a block of the apartment. Would definitely recommend.
We stayed here for 5 days and everything was fabulous! The apartment is perfect. Very clean and with all the necessary amenities. Location is a major plus of this apartment as well. It is located on a quaint street full of restaurants, markets, and energy! Short walk to metro and the ever-popular marais. Would definitely stay here again!
Jean-François was a great host. Very flexible, helpful and his apartment was the best place ever! Wo loved it! It was a great trip. Thanks to Jean-François!
Appartment was perfect! Cozy, modern in a very typical french building with Its courtyard. The location is amazing. The street is so lively!! Bakeries, butchers, fruits&veg as if you had a market at opening the door. And of course, coffees and terraces. Not to mention that underground is only 5min away... Will be back for sure!!!!
Stunning apartment - so cool! So cool in fact, that I struggled to get my daughter out of it to go and see Paris. Her favourite thing about the city was 'chillin' in the apartment'! Brilliant location - it's at the back of a quiet courtyard on a pedestrianized street - so no traffic noise at all. The street itself is buzzy and lively, loads of cafes and bars, great bakery - oldest in Paris, fromagerie, fruit shops etc. Walking distance to the Louvre and 3 metro stops very close. The bed and sofa bed are really good quality - very comfortable. Fantastic shower too - a lot of thought has gone into this apartment and it shows. All communications and directions very clear too. this was the first time we have used Airbnb and we are so impressed. Will definitely be back!
Just perfect!
JF's apartment was really lovely and I had a great stay. He was brilliant at communicating and making sure I had everything I needed. Really hope to be back soon!"

Just an amazing place and as a first time user of airbnb couldn't be happier. Jean is a great host, location is simply superb, having a glass of wine next to the Eiffel Tower just perfect. It's not luxury but it's full of character and warmth and you be fools not to book. The only slight drama is the loo which needs a proper toilet installed to make this the perfect stay. Give my regards to the black cat when you stay and have an amazing time.......
We had an amazing time in Jean's house boat, Le Soleil! It is located right across from the Eiffel Tower and very central to the city including access to multiple Metro stations if you need to get around. The stay on Le Soleil made our honeymoon in Paris very memorable and we were very happy to find this gem in Paris!
We just returned from a two week trip through France, and the highlight was unquestionably the stay in Jean's fabulous houseboat! Location, location, location! In your wildest dreams you can't be any better situated in Paris. Jean's hospitality was incredible -- he did so many little things for us that one should not even imagine to expect! The boat is so comfortable -- a very warm living area with pieces of his world collections everywhere -- and plenty of room for us to host a five person cocktail party with friends one night.... and where else could you enjoy a glass of wine on the upper deck while watching the light show of the Eiffel tower every night? The kitchen is very easy for preparing meals and has ample room for several people. As far as the bathroom, well, I think it has been said before, it is a challenge, but what boat wastes space on that room? It is just part of boat life! And free parking in Paris! It was one of the most unique places we have enjoyed in our extended travels! Thank you again, Jean!
Jean was a great host and Le Soleil was perfect. The boat is well equipped and comfortable and quiet. Everything was spectacular and exceeded our expectations. Just to confirm what others have written, the tour boats do come often and the boat moves but we loved that and didn't at all mind! It was fabulous and we will do it again as soon as possible!
We had such a great stay on Jean's boat! My husband and I stayed for three days over the weekend and I must say we are planning on coming back some day. The location is perfect, and the views of the Eiffel Tower are breathtaking. Jean was also a fabulous host who was available for a late check-in and provided answers to all of our questions. If you have a chance to stay in this house boat you should do it! You will not regret it.
My first experience with AirBNB couldn't have been better! Jean received us with flowers, fresh fruits and a bottle of wine. He speaks English very well and was kind enough to lend us some maps and share some information about the surroundings. The Soleil has an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower and is close to a metro station (Passy), so transport is as easy as it can get. It's a really charming place to be. The Seine current is calm and the boat shakes only a bit, mostly when the Bateaux Mouches pass by. The bathroom is a little tricky at first, but works nicely once you get the hang of it. I definetly recommend the Soleil to anyone who wishes to spend unforgettable days in Paris.
Staying on Jean's péniche was the best experience for our first trip in Paris!!! The péniche was absolutely beautiful and exceeded our expectations. We were welcomed by Jean, he greeted us and gave us a tour of the péniche, to our surprise, left us with a bottle of wine and snacks upon our welcome. Truly a romantic stay we've ever experienced, this boat offered us stunning and I have to say, the absolute best views of the eiffel tower all throughout day and night. The fun part, you're right on La Seine and get nothing less than first class seating to view the iconic tower, all the best combinations of Paris combined. Much better than what commercial hotels have to offer which originally we were looking to book but none offered everything we were in search for. What made this trip more memorable, my now fiancée prosposed to me on Le Pont de Bir-Hakeim, which also you can see from from the péniche. This trip to Paris has made some unforgettable memories for us and we definetly will be back. See you soon Jean! Merci Beaucoup! :)
What a romantic place to stay at! It is just like Jean's photos. The location is amazing. His boat is very nicely designed and Jean is a wonderful host just like all other reviewers have said. Thank you for letting us share your place, Jean!
We finished a four week stay in France with a stay on the peniche “Soleil”. We could not have asked for a better ending for our trip. Jean met us, showed us his home, provided wine, flowers, and information about the area and left us with his phone number should we need help. The location is convenient to metros, stores, and sights. As this was not our first visit to Paris, we spent most of the time enjoying the view. The “Soleil” has everything you need to enjoy your stay. If you want something a bit different, this is a great place to stay with a charming host.
Jean was a perfect host. Provided enough information about the area for us to feel welcomed, but gave us the privacy and freedom to make Péniche SOLEIL our home. The boat a quaint and nautical with all the amenities that one would expect a floating vessel to have. Péniche SOLEIL was an ideal site to begin our Parisian Adventure. We will return one day."

It's nearby the mainstreet but It's quiet. The owner of the house is very enthusiastic, and he came for saying hello! As for the traffic, maybe the clostest subway stations are a little bit far from the house, for baby and old people. If we wanted to get the subway station, we have to walk 7-8 minutes. If we get to the Louvre by taxi, it needs 15 eruo.
The week we spent in Paris was magical and it was all because of the fabulous apartment we rented. The apartment was huge and we all (7 of us) had plenty of space and loved living like Parisians if only for one week. The apartment is decorated in a wonderful manner and we enjoyed having dinner parties and eating breakfast all together as well as having an after dinner drink in the spacious living room. The apartment made our experience magical- I would recommend this to anyone who wants to go to Paris... It was my 50th celebration and the apartment was what made it a magical week-- I will be back for sure!!!!
We were excited about staying in Dolgo's house, but we had no idea what a treat we were in for! He and his staff went above and beyond our (email hidden)e location is wonderful, within walking distance of the Arc d' Triomphe and the Champs Elysee. The house is beautifully furnished with treasures from all over the world. This especially appealed to my love of unique things. Even though we had 4 small children with us, Dolgo was very gracious and didn't seem concerned about his valuable items. My son loves to cook. The kitchen and dining room are well equipped. He made the 10 of us several wonderful meals. Even though we like to clean up after ourselves, the housekeeper (who also made us crepes several times), insisted that we leave it for her to do. She even ironed for us and washed clothes! Dolgo's assistant helped us with several matters, including helping us find a bus tour and even helping me take care of a credit card issue! The only problem was no outside space for the children to play, but Monceau Park is withing walking distance. (However, the two 18 year old boys we had with us did go outside a throw a football around.) We were concerned about the children being too loud for the neighbors, but as far as I know, no one complained. Everyone in the family thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Paris, and staying in Dolgo's house made it even more special.
What a fantastic find and a marvelous host. Dolgo was absolutely the definition of a detail oriented host. What ever our wish, he treated us as if we were family visiting and was concerned of our well being and happiness. I would gladly and hope to rent this """"home"""" again. Your really felt as a true Parian with France at your door step. Again, Dolgo you are an interresting and truly caring person. We wish you the best and hope to stay at your marvelous flat in the future. Merci! Voila!
Fabulous flat with central location. Lots of attention to detail from our host. Just a home from home. Looking for an excuse to return.
absolutely amazing apartment and owner! flat is much more impressive and beautiful then shown on the pictures. great location, atmosphere, comfortable bedrooms and bathrooms.
This is a truly amazing apartment. It is out of the tourist area, yet only a short walk from the Arc de Triomphe and close to restaurants and a great street market. The apartment itself is huge and filled with amazing antiques and furniture. It is in a beautiful building and has its own courtyard and lift. Coming and going you really feel like a (very ritzy) local. Dolgo is great. We needed some extra utensils to prepare our special NYE dinner, and he went straight out and bought them and more. The maid was wonderful; she cleaned and washed, and even made our girls a huge stack of pancakes. Staying in an apartment like this makes the Paris experience very special.
We just returned from a trip to France where we spent three wonderful days in this amazing apartment. It is so beautiful and so nice that I am surprised that Dolgo will rent it out! Dolgo was a wonderful host, meeting us at the apartment when we arrived. He wanted us to feel like it was our home. It is so big that you almost get lost in it. It is also decorated with beautiful antiques and collections from Dolgo's travels. We felt like we were staying in a palace. The neighborhood is also great - good restaurants in walking distance & shopping but also very quiet. We could walk to the Arc de Trimph but there were no tourists on our streets. I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone going to Paris. You can feel like a real Parisian in a beautiful setting.
We were so impressed with a beautifull place we got, it was large, clean, well decorated, we felt like we were at home. Dolgo was very nice, let us completely take over the place, we were pleased with a dinner we were provided by the time we arrived by the maid, her pancakes were awsome, she cleaned the place everyday we didn't have to worry about that part at all. Dolgo thank you very much again, we enjoyed our stay. P.S. location is great. walking distance to all major Paris attractions. Definatelly recomend to everyone!
The apartment was fantastic. It was even better than the pictures showed. You felt like you were living with family in a beautiful part of Paris. The Landlord and his assistant very great to deal with and they responded quickly to any questions we had. The location was very convenient. It was 5 minutes from a Metro stop and 15 minutes from the Arc. Many local restaurants to choose from. The best part was the delicious crepes that the housekeeper made for us upon arrival.
We were very satisfied with your flat from various aspects- 1. Location- central and very close to the Paris Marathon starting point ( as you remember- all of us participated in the Marathon). 2. Design- the flat is most beautiful and created a “Hamish” atmosphere with the multiple personal collections you have there ( worldwide souvenirs, sculptures, paintings, furniture, etc. ) . 3. Setting- having a roomy kitchen, a comfortable dining room with all the necessities , 4 comfortable bedrooms including bathrooms and toilets- enabled us the same level of comfort as if we were staying in a hotel. 4. Maintenance- the fact during most of the days there was a cleaning service ( by Svetlana) 5. Hospitality- we felt most welcomed during the entire stay and were even spoiled with Svetlana’s yummy crepes J ( please don’t forget to forward the recipe ….) Some notes for improvement- 1. We recommend that the house maintenance services will be kept 7 days a week ( including weekends) in order to make the flat fully comparable to hotel services 2. Bed linen- will be helpful to add an extra blanket to each room Thanks again very much for your hospitality , making our stay in Paris memorable!
Un lieu magnifique et magique grâce à Laurent, aussi prévenant qu'accueillant. Notre séjour à Paris a été fantastique. Un grand merci à Laurent et aux personnes qui l'accompagnent d'avoir été aussi disponibles et sympathiques. L'appartement est décoré merveilleusement : Avec goût et Chaleur. Les chambres sont spacieuses et tout y est pensé pour que le séjour soit aussi agréable que confortable. Nous y retournerons dès que possible .
Our stay in Paris would not have been as amazing as it was, without the comfort and pleasure of this beautiful home. I can not say enough about our experience here...except for the fact that I wish it were longer. Perfectly located in a quiet district with an amazing farmers market just blocks away and moments from all that Paris is known for. We will never forget our trip, or the hospitality and service provided. Can't wait to go back.
Parfait! Mon week-end s'est déroulé tel je l'avais rêvé depuis de nombreux mois, et pourtant je suis plutôt du genre (très) exigeante! Merci pour la qualité de la prestation!
I cannot say enough about this Parisienne apartment. It made our vacation. 5 of us visited Paris and stayed in this magnificent place in a residential area but minutes away from the Arc de Triumph and the Champs d'Lysee . Metro was 1/ block away and a few blocks away is. a Wonderful farmers market where you can get your croissants, wine cheeses and baguette. The apartment is beautiful, the owner was so helpful and Svetlana, who cleaned our rooms is. Treasure. I would send everyone I know to experience their vacation in this apartment and I know we will be going back again. Paris has to be visited often and this place emerges you in it ambience.
Our experience was just perfect with Dolgo! He was incredibly kind and generous to us in his beautiful apartment. His antiques are stunning! The apartment was immaculate and we are definitely coming back for another stay. I really felt like we were staying with a dear friend. The house was prepared and offered to us with such generosity that we were overwhelmed. The entire experience enriched our stay in Paris. I would not hesitate to recommend this apartment to anyone, it was wonderful!
This apt. was absolutely beautiful and fulfilled all our expectations. Dolgo is just the best of all hosts and our family enjoyed every minute. Cannot imagine better accomodations in all of Paris - always felt it was just such a privilege to be there! Thank you so much for the experience - wouldn't hesitate to recommend.
Hi Dolgo, We had a great time in Paris and your apartment was wonderful. We loved the neighborhood, the closeness to the market, shopping, metro and downtown Paris. The apartment and the service were outstanding. We will recommend you to all our friends and hopefully will be back in the near future. Best regards, Manoel and friends
Dolga and his team has been welcomed us great. House is A++++ you can find there 5 star hotel comfort even better. Design is particularly outstanding. If you are lucky enough to find his place calender is available i would say do not wait a minute because you can lose your chance suddenly.
This apartment is superb. And our host was most friendly and available to us. We had. A very memorable stay and hope to return."

The flat is small but very cozy and well equipped (even with a Nespresso coffe machine). Just keep in mind this is a 5th floor without elevator. About Sara, she is a great hostess, very kind and helpful.
a very clean and comfortable place in a superb Paris location. I was there for just one night but it worked out very well for me. thanks Sara!!
The location is perfect! Centrally located in the area of Saint Germain des Pres and also very near the metro station. Literally a stone throw from the major department store of le bon marche and other cafe which deeply reflects the typical Parisian atmosphere. Sara was a great host who has been very responsive and able to provide solution actively in the event there is a problem. Will definitely come back if possible!
Idéalement situé dans un des quartiers les plus prisés de Paris, l'appartement bénéficie d'une très belle luminosité. Très propre et très pratique, il correspond réellement aux photographies présentées par le site. Sara est une personne très sympathique et surtout très disponible. C'est vraiment une qualité. Alors, Sara, encore merci pour votre accueil. Je recommande particulièrement cette location.
Je suis ravie de mes deux nuits passées chez Sara. Elle était indisponible et c'est un ami qui m'a chaleureusement accueillie. Cependant Sara est toujours joignable sur son portable. L'appartement est tel que décrit. Attention cependant pour les personnes à mobilité réduite, il se situe au cinquième étage sans ascenseur. Merci encore Sara .
Saras flat is nice and clean, she was the perfect host. The perfect place to discover Paris. Close by is a Metro Station and several Vélib rental stations - the Seine is a 15-minutes-walk away!
Estuvimos muy contentas en el estudio de Sara. La ubicación es estupenda en un barrio muy alegre y bonito, lo que hace que la experiencia de visitar Paris empiece muy bien. La calle es bastante ruidosa pero sobre las 11 pm los lugares cierran y todo se calma. El wifi muy bien. Nos ha gustado, volvería.
I really recommend to stay at Sara's place while you're visiting Paris. Sara is very nice and flexible about arrival and departure times. The apartment is cozy, bright and clean and has everything you need. It is placed right in the centre of the Latin Quarter in the charming Rue du Pot de Fer where a lot of nice bars, restaurants, creperies etc are (website hidden). Monge is a 2 min walk away and from there, there is a metro station so it is easy to commute to anywhere in Paris. Getting there from the airport is easy as well as the Luxemborg station is only a 10 min walk away and from here you can take the RER B line to either CDG or Orly. So all in all Sara's apartment is definitely the place to reside while you're in Paris. Cheers Martin
The apartment has a perfect location. It is located in the quartier latin near bars and nice restaurants . It is small, clean and quite equipped. However the coach is very uncomfortable and I wouldn't recommend it for sleep. Sara was nice and communicative although she got into the apartment twice.
Une nuit passée avec une communication efficace avec l'hôte. Studio légèrement bruyant et canapé lit peu confortable. Sara est une personne accueillante.
My friend and I had a great stay here..great location close to lots of places to eat, and Sara is very kind and helpful.
Tout simplement parfait! Appartement charmant,propre,situé dans un tres chouette quartier. Accueil sympathique. Sara était très accessible. Comblée mon séjour etait top! Je recommande et retournerai volontiers chez Sara pour ma prochaine escapade! Merci Sara.
Sara's flat is great. It was my first airbnb experience and it was more than I wished for! The flat is well located in the 5th quarter of Paris, which is also known as The Latin Quarter. It is not that touristy as other parts of Paris' center, and there's a lot of bars, cafe's, restaurants, supermarket, boulangeries and patisseries right across the street and around the apartment. The Place Monge metro station is within 3 minutes walk and gets you directly to the most touristy parts of the city. The flat is very very clean, there's TV and a well equipped but small kitchen. Sara was very communicative, helpful and flexible with late checkouts and stuff. In my opinion the flat is more suitable for one person. If you arrive in Paris, I'm telling you - book Sara's place. The area is awesome and the flat has everything you need. You won't be disappointed.
I loved staying in Sara's cozy apartment. It's located in a gorgeous pedestrian zone in the heart of Paris with beautiful little streets full of restaurants, bars and shops. Sara is incredibly nice and takes good care of her guests. I certainly recommend this apartment."

I have spent 4 nights in Arthurs appartment with my 3 girlfriends, as we came to celebrate my birthday. The location is fantastic, flat is cosy, clean and modern, fully equiped. And our host - Arthur, not only he carries big heavy suitcases easilly, but knows the best restaurants nearby!
Exactly what you can see on the pictures, plus a tiny but worthwhile balcony. Everything went smoothly, excellent standards, superb location. I would definitely repeat and reccommend.
Super Gite. Parfait pour passer quelques jours à la campagne et vraiment très proche de Paris. Pizzeria bio très sympa juste à côté pour le soir d'arrivée. Maison calme et très agréable. A recommander. Nous y reviendrons sans doute!
It was a great visit. The apartement was everything it was said to be, and Arthur was a very nice host.
Thank you for a wonderful stay in your apartment! We were very impressed with the standard and loved the rain water shower and little balcony. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and everything well cleaned. Basically we loved it! Once we navigated our way around the Parisian backstreets we greatly appreciated the awesome location...just got lost a few times on our own accord. Would happily recommend this place to everyone ☺
The place is really nice. The location was perfect for us. It is close (15min walk) to train station North. Arthur was clear in the communication and Manuela, who received us, was really nice.

Great cozy apartment in the center of Paris, tastefully decorated, Clean , bright and spacious. I wont hesitate to stay there again when visitiing Paris.
We spent 5 days at the apartment and loved it very much. The flat is beautifully designed, well equiped and wonderfully located. A place we recommend for staying right in Paris.
The apartment is absolutely fantastic. Has everything you need and more. Location is perfect, don't even need the metro you can walk to most of the best spots in Paris. 4 levels of a spiral staircase was quite a workout but nothing that would prevent me from staying in this location. If you are actively healthy it's a non issue Arthur was always in constant contact and willing to resolve any issues that may have arisen. Very professional
It was a lovely apartment, comfortable and extremely well located. I will definitely recommend it!
Had a great stay, and the place is so well located. We walked everywhere. It is well designed, clean and when you are done exploring Paris you have a little home to rest your feet.
We stayed at the apartment at Rue du Bourg l'Abbe for 5 nights and overall it was a great stay. Very central apartment in the heart of a nice, trendy neighbourhood with easy access to eating and drinking, shopping and attractions. The apartment is spacious with modern decor and updated appliances and the wall of windows gives you a great classically Parisian street view. Arthur was great to deal with, highly responsive to emails and questions and was even kind enough to call ahead and make reservations to a restaurant for us while we were travelling through Europe without a phone. The only negative was that there's no lift in the building so carrying two large suitcases up four flights is not ideal (but shouldn't hinder your decision to stay at the apartment). We were also charged the cleaning, linens and late check-in fees which was quite substantial so you should plan to have enough cash on hand upon arrival if you run into the same situation. Overall though, I wouldn't hesitate recommending this apartment to anyone looking for a luxurious stay in Paris.
We loved staying in this apt! It's exactly as showed in the pictures, the heating is very good, and the internet was very fast! It's very well located. There's a bakery just on the corner, and many restaurants and pubs nearby. The sub is near too. The building is very charming and the stairs too. We had to wait outside for half an hour, and as we were tired and it was cold, of course it was not confy...but when Manuela arrived she was very kind and explained everything to us. Arthur and Manuela were very professional. We'd definitely stay in this apt again!

Lovely and very quiet place in the middle of a vibrant and upcoming area. Lea and her brother supported us in everything we needed. We fully recommend this place to everybody looking for """"l'experience parisienne réelle et authentique"""". Thanks Lea!
Gorgeous apartment and charming neighbourhood ... Will definitely be back! Thank you Lea for having us! We ha a great time!
Lea's place is lovely, has everything and is warm. Once you are behind the big front door it is wonderfully quiet and private.We were very happy there during our 5 days in Paris.
Lea was a particularly friendly and accommodating host, with her apartment the typical Parisian abode we had hoped for. Nicely decorated and in a great location for exploring the city on foot, I would highly recommend Lea's for a romantic weekend away.
Lea's place is charming, clean and well equipped. the apartment is in a good area and close to two metro lines. communication was very easy and quick, and Lea was very kind and considered. it was perfect for me. thank you Lea for this lovely spot in Paris.
We stayed at Lea's apartment for 8 days, she have a very nice apartment, just 2 blocks from the metro, It's located near to nice restaurants, bakeries and supermarkets. It is very well equipped, you have everything you need to enjoy your stay in Paris. I would Definitely recommend Lea's place to anyone I know! Thanks, hope to see you soon!!
We were five colleagues staying in Lea's apartment for a training session in Paris. Very clear communication, amazing, spacious apartment, and perfect location on a quiet street (between the Canal and Republique). Would definitely recommend a stay here.
Lea was very helpful and welcoming. Just arrived there was a small problem with the hot water but Lea was very attentive and she had already organized an intervention that she has followed personally. The apartment was clean and equipped. A great stay!
The reservation was canceled 43 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
Lea was great at communicating before our stay and her husband was very helpful when we checked in. We really liked the area - the only thing I would say is that there isn't a great view from the apartment which we expected from the photos.
Lea was so friendly and helpful and her little flat was amazing. I can only give her my best recommendations.
It's a very cozy apartment and in a great location. Lea is very friendly and she's easy to reach if needed. She gave us great recommendation for lunch spots! One thing though, it's some narrow spiral staircases that lead to the apartment so people with large luggages might find it difficult. It wasn't a problem for us and once we are in the apartment we felt very relaxed because of the simple but charming decor and comfy sofas and bed.
We had a fabulous stay in Lea's gorgeous Parisian apartment. The apartment was much bigger then we expected and the photos do not do it justice. Lea was lovely and extremely responsive to all of our correspondence. I would highly recommend this apartment as it is beautiful, and truly Parisian chic. This is a fabulous apartment.
Lea was the kindest host and the apartment was immaculate and had everything I needed for my stay. The neighborhood is wonderful too. I would stay at Lea's place again in a heartbeat.
What a fantastic apartment! Beautifully furnished and in a great location for exploring Paris. There was 10 of us staying in the apartment and we had plenty of room. Lea is a great host, very welcoming and gave us lots of information about the area. Would definitely recommend staying here!

Absolutely everything about this apartment made us feel like home and definitely enhanced with charm our Paris experience. The location is also great! Really close to metro stations, restaurants and markets. We were 3 couples - everybody loved it!!!! Definitely recommend this place for your stay. - And by the way - Lea is also wonderful!!!! Very responsive and attentive to everything we asked her for. - Consider staying at this place if you want to experience a real taste of the Parisian life style.
Very beautiful apartment in a great area. The kitchen is well equiped and there is a nice selection of magazines, books and dvd's. We slept there with 10 people, which was still very comfortable, but light sleepers on the sofabeds and in the room with the sliding wall might have trouble with the noise. Lea left us a list of recommended restaurants etc, which was very useful. A pity that the best baker of Paris (just a street away) was on it's Christmass holiday - we will have to come back.
Great flat, very nice owners, perfectly enjoyable experience. Thank you very much indeed! Will certainly recommend, and try to stay again myself

Her place is immaculately clean and the room extremely comfortable. It's very quiet too, for a relaxing respite from any Paris noise. As a bonus, the Bistro Paul Bert is around the corner (as is their more casual place le 6 Paul Bert). I ate at both and they were among the best lunches and suppers I've ever had!! The 11ieme is definitely worth prowling around, more neighborhood than touristy, which I like. In the morning I went to a market and bought excellent cheese and fruit. There is a very nice wine store nearby as well, with many interesting moderately priced wines. I would go back in an instant; in fact, I'm planning another trip for the not too distant future, and I can certainly recommend Maguy's place!
Perfect place, graet host
Maguy's place was very clean and nice! The host was very polite and provided breakfast for us. It was in the perfect location to catch the Metro and Bus. The neighborhood was nice. We even found a bakery nearby that we went to each night on our way back from visiting the sights.
Perfect location in Paris. Great host and very welcoming! Quiet and clean. Great french breakfast ;-)
J'ai passé un excellent séjour chez Maguy, qui est très sympathique et serviable. Tout correspond aux photos publiées : chambre spacieuse, lumineuse et calme (ne donne pas sur la rue), literie confortable, appartement bien décoré et en excellent état, Internet performant, situation à deux pas du métro. Et la cerise sur la gâteau : baguette fraiche tous les matins au petit-déjeuner ! Vivement recommandé !
Jolie chambre très calme et très propre avec petit déjeuner complet Maguy est une hôte serviable et discrète Je reviendrais
thanks maguy for the wonderful stay
très agréable séjour dans cette jolie chambre calme belle déco cuisine et salle de bains également être réveillée par le chant des oiseaux est un luxe rare à Paris accueil sympathique e
I had an amazing time staying at Maguy's. She is a great host, really friendly and ready to help. The only thing, the noisy neighbours upstairs.
We've spend a weekend in Paris at Maguy's place and I would like to recommend this great host and her nice appartment to everyone. She was very kind and helpful, she knows """"her"""" city very well so you can get very handy tips for visiting the city, and the breakfast was a very pleasant way to start the day, The appartment itself is very clean, a warm and cosy oasis in a quiet neighbourhood, close to a few metro stations (only 2 minutes walking), so ideal for exploring the city during daytime and returning to a nice bed in the evening. There are also afew shops, markets and restaurants close to the appointment, so you can find everything you would ever need in the surrounding area. When returning to Paris, I would certainly check if the room is available, I enjoyed staying at Maguy's and if possible we will come over next time again. A big plus, thank you Maguy !
This was a great stay! I absolutely loved Paris, and our host Maguy. She helped us do laundry, print documents for travel, and gave us a lovely French breakfast each morning. I cannot describe how utterly happy we were from our stay. I definitely recommend this place for anyone!
Nice stay! Good location!
We had a very pleasant stay. The room is as described and the appartment is located perfectly to get around the city by metro. We had a key to the appartment so we were totally flexible about when to leave and come. I highly reccomend this to everyone.
Ce fut notre première expérience Air Bnb et nous avons été ravis ! Maguy est une hôte très agréable et sympathique, et très disponible ! La chambre était très confortable et propre, et surtout calme ; l'emplacement est idéal !
Staying at Maguys was great! She is a lovely host. Everything is really tidy and clean and Maguy can give you good advise on how to get around in Paris. She even gave us maps and guides for the city to use during our stay. Really recommendable!
We had a great time at Paris. The apartment was fine and we had everything we needed.
Very nice stay in Paris, perfect location. The room is nicely equiped and very quiet. Thank you Maguy for letting us leave our luggage till late in the evening.
Maguy ist a very friendly and helpful host. Everything was fine and easy to handle with her. She prepared a nice french breakfast every morning. The flat was clean and there was no problem in sharing the bathroom with two other guests. We also liked the location around the flat with nice restaurants and cafes. There is a Metro station close to the flat (5 minutes to walk). All in all we really enjoyed our trip to Paris and we can highly recommend Maguy as a host!
O quarto é ótimo, a localização é muito boa e a hospitalidade de Maguy é excelente. Nos ajudou bastante!
Beautiful and very clean room, also a nice and clean bathroom and kitchen. Good breakfast. Located centrally, only a few minutes to a metro station. Open-minded and friendly host. Couldn't have been better!"

Emma and Boris are wonderful hosts, really nice people! The apartment is really nice, clean, very dodgy space for several people, has everything you need to be nice with a group of people. It is really well located, we had a great stay at this apartment, worth choose it and enjoy Paris knowing that you accounts with so comfortable like this apartment for you and your group of family or friends.
Very convenient apartment, at a great location, less than a minute walk to the metro station. The Bastille (with its Sunday Market) and place de Vosges within walking distance. Supermarkets and Boulangeries as well. Safe neighborhood. Very clean, up-kept, good mattresses and well-equipped kitchen. Definitely enough space for a group of ten! The pictures of the apartment are accurate. The apartment is on the second floor and it should be noted that second flight of stairs to the apartment are very steep, probably something to consider with a group with young children or elderly. Additionally, the stairs inside the triplex (two flight of stairs) have no banister. Since in our group we had no young children this was not a problem. Thank you EMMA for everything!
Stayed at this excellent apartment in a wonderful Paris neighborhood with two colleagues on a business trip. Numerous excellent cafes and restaurants are around the area, and it is nicely off the tourist track, while being close enough to get to the big Paris sites after a short walk or metro ride. Emma and her husband were very welcoming and helpful, and the apartment is both super functional and kinda cool. Highly recommended.
Highly recommend the apartment. The location is excellent and very close to a metro entrance + surrounded by shops near the market + plenty of excellent bars and restaurants in surrounding streets. The apartment was located in a quiet secure courtyard well separated from the noise of the street. Inside it was well appointed and comfortable for our group of 7. The hosts were friendly + helpful and accommodating, even managing to squeeze our large car into the small garage.
Living in Paris in this apartment for almost a week, was one of my best holiday experiences. The apartment is 1 minute far away from metro station, and it is in a lovely part of Paris which is full of restaurants and green parks. However the neighborhood is a bit crowded and full of energy, the windows are looking to an inner court which is very silent all the time. I highly recommend this place for families, it is huge and very cosy. Emma was helpful and friendly all the time. She was waiting for us in the apartment, gave us the keys, and helped us whenever we had some problems. All in all it is a perfect place for a group of people to spend their holiday in Paris.
Perfekter Ausgangspunkt für einen Parisaufenthalt, wenn man es familiär und persönlich mag. Emma ist super nett und hilfsbereit. Saubere und total gemütliche Unterkunft, ein Kleinod inmitten einer Metropole! Perfekt, dass es eine Garage gibt. Die Erreichbarkeit der Rue de Montreuil ausgehend vom Rheinland ist super angenehm und ideal ohne wilde Verkehrsknäuel. Im Viertel gibts alles, was man braucht, ob Supermarkt, Wochenmarkt oder Restaurants verschiedenster Art! Super Verkehrsanbindung, denn die Metro ist 2 min zu Fuß entfernt. Es war einfach toll! Ganz lieben Dank Emma! Und hoffentlich auf bald.
L'appartamento di Emma non solo è bello da vedere perchè rispecchia il classico appartamento moderno parigino ma è anche molto funzionale (ha tutte le comodità che una casa deve avere). La posizione è ottimale perchè vicino alla metro , vicino al marais (il quartiere più bello di Parigi)ed è situato in un quartiere ricco di negozi ristoranti super market ecc.Emma è molto ospitale ma soprattutto gentile(mi ha rispedito una cosa che avevo lasciato nella sua casa senza nessun problema). Consiglio a tutti questa scelta per immergersi nella vita vera parigina.
Emma is very courtesy and kindness. We stayed very well in the cosy-chic studio and for five days it seemed to be a true Parisian. The studio is very nice, clean, practical and with all the comforts and a good price. The metro is near (100 mt). The backery, the pharmacy and the supermarket are all in 100/200mt. Very pratic. People traveling with family knows what I mean. For a family....the best solution. A nice experience that I'll do again in the future....next time I'll go to Paris. Emma è una persona estremamente cortese e gentile. Siamo stati molto bene nel cosy-chic studio e per cinque giorni ci è sembrato di essere dei veri parigino. Lo studio è molto bello, pulito, pratico e con tutti i comforts e con un buon prezzo. La metro è vicine (100mt). Il fornaio, la farmacia ed il supermarket sono tutti entro 100/200mt. Molto pratico. Chi viaggia con la familia sa quello che vuol dire. Per una familia....la soluzione miliore. Una bella esperienza che farò ancora in futuro...la prossima volta che andrò a Parigi.
Le studio était super, très propre, bien équipé, aménagé avec beaucoup de goût et surtout très facile à trouver! La communication avec Emma était parfaite également; soit UN REVE:)! Merci beaucoup Emma, à bientôt!
Super appartement convivial et très bien équipé à 2 pas du métro et a quelques minutes du quartier très animé de Bastille bref un emplacement idéal pour partir à la découverte de Paris, faire les boutiques et sortir je le recommande vivement Isabelle
Huge Parisian apartment, wonderful interior design, perfect to have great vacation in Paris with friends or/and family. Central Paris and near metro station, great to visit Paris. Karine
An adorable HUGE apartment in a great location. Wonderful for a family to use when in Paris - lots of space, and very comfortable!! Has a lovely kitchen, too! :)"

We felt wonderfully at home and comfortable among the artworks and velvet and slept deeply on the excellent beds. A great location and a wonderful space from which to venture forth and explore the cultural richness fo Paris.
We had a very nice stay at the appartment of Philippe. The weather was so good, that we were outside most of the time. The location is super, you can walk or take the metro. We were with our two children and that was perfect. But I think the appartment fits better for 3 than 4 adults, if you are with friends.. But who wants to go to Paris to stay inside....
We were extremely happy on this apartment and Philippe was super kind and helpful with everything. Everything was clean and in a very nice area. We definitely recommend this apartment to everyone who want to travel to Paris.
Philippe A big thank you for welcoming us to your perfect flat. It was a great place to explore Paris and we really enjoyed our stay. Tom, Sue and family
The apartment and Philippe Polselli were both superb. Philippe was always in touch, answering immediately when contacted, We especially appreciated his arranging a taxi pick up for us in the early morning, and for taking our luggage down, picking up the keys, and seeing us off. When we were home he asked if we had left certain items on purpose, or for disposal, and we couldn't have asked for more from our host.
This was a very cozy appartment, well suited for four persons and it had Everything that you would need (hair dryer, kitchen Tools, etc). The location was also good with a Walking distance to nice shopping and restaurant/bar areas. Phillipe is really nice and it was no problem at all to arrange meetings to pick up and leave the keys to the appartment.
We stayed in Paris for a week.(9/21~9/28) Philippe's apartment was very nice, looks at the sky terrace and panoramic views of the city were so beautiful. Double bed in the main room was large and spacious, the bedding was warm and comfortable. And in a small room had additional single bed! So we three people were able to get enough rest. The Bathroom was clean, warm water was always ready. And well-dried towels and shampoos were also adequately equipped. About ransportation, the Metro Line 9 (Voltaire and Saint-Ambroise) was close, easy to move in. And the No.69 bus had been the most useful transportation for us. In addition the Bastille market, held on sunday near the apartment, gave us unforgettable experience. Finally, Philippe - the owner of apartment - was very kind and friendly. At any time, he was ready to respond to our needs, and confirmed with a message for our regards. When we had a small problem for washing machine, he gave response to us quickly and kindly. And he prepared Madeleine for us as welcome gift. It was very delicious!!! Paris was lovely city so we want to visit again. And if it possible, we want to use Philippe's apartment again. We recommend for you to experience it!
It was a great apartment, located in the center. Philippe was very kind and helped us a lot to feel comfort and safe. We would recommend Philippe's place to any one who would like to feel at home in Paris. Thank you very much.
Nice appartment, close to shops, restaurants , the metro. The neighbourhood felt safe. Philippe is a friendly and helpfull guy and came immediately late in the evening, when we had a small problem. We had a great time there.
Due to a last minute emergency, I was unable to actually stay in this flat managed by Philippe. However, he was INCREDIBLY helpful throughout the entire situation and truly went above and beyond any expectation I would have had of a host. He helped me find a new place in Paris and paid for it himself. If I return to Paris, I will absolutely look to stay with him. He responded to my messages almost immediately and I found him to be extremely trustworthy and considerate. Thank you, Phillipe!
We arrived late to Leece due to all trains being completely to (it was a holiday) but our host arrived a second time to pick us up at the train station. We felt so at ease knowing he would take us to his apartment. The apartment is even better than is pictured! It was amazing and we walked everywhere. But if you prefer to take the city bus it is located just one block down the street at no cost. We absolutely recommend this location! All bedding, towels, music he provides, wifi, and many other extras were better than a five star hotel.
We had a lovely time in Philippe's cute little Paris apartment! It is situated in a sweet neighborhood within comfortable walking distance to the tube and major sights like Notre Dame and the Louvre. It felt that we were """"living"""" in Paris instead of just being a tourist. The beds were comfortable and the WiFi was good. Philippe was a wonderful host! He helped us find the apartment when we got lost, helped us drag our 3 very large suitcases up 4 flights of stairs and even called a taxi for our departure since I couldn't pronounce the street names. The shower and toilet were a bit small and tricky to manage, but nothing too difficult. Overall we had a fabulous time and I would highly recommend staying here to anyone in the future!
This was my first time using airbnb and what a great experience. The apartment was just as it was presented on the site and exactly what I was looking for. The host was very helpful,the appartment was clean, and we slept like babes each night with the window open on our top floor abode. the apartment was just a 10 minute walk away from Notre Dame. I was able to make breakfast each morning on our petite stove top. Thank you again. We would definitely stay again.
This apartment although small is great. Ideally located in the heart of the Marais it's newly refurbished and nicely done.
Phillipe, Thanks so much for the lovely stay. The Marais location was prefect and the apartment was exactly what we needed for a quick and comfortable stay in Paris. I especially loved the loft view of rooftops! Thanks again, Carolyn
Anne fell in love with Philippe's apartment and now wants to move to Paris and live in it! It's very large and has big windows with lots of light. It's also in a great location. Less than 10 minutes walk to the Censier Daubenton station on the #7 Metro line which goes right to the Louvre. About a 15 minute walk to the RER B line which goes directly to the Gare du Nord (Railroad station) and all the way to CDG airport. And best of all, it's a 5 minute walk to the wonderful Rue Mouffetard, one of the oldest streets in Paris, with a bustling, permanent street market. If you love food, you'll love Rue Mouffetard! Philippe gave us great directions on the best way to get to and from his apartment. He met us there with two sets of keys, as requested, and communication with him was easy. We'll definitely be contacting him again on our next trip to Paris.
The reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

Fantastic apartment - the kitchen and bathroom are tiny but absolutely perfect. Great location and Philippe welcoming and extremely efficient. Totally recommend it, can't wait to go back!
Great apartment, as described and very well presented. Had a great time and would stay again. Thanks.
Great location. Comfy beds. Great breton creperie just across the road and super bar brasserie right underneath. Playground across the street. Picasso museum is being renovated but not noisy. Very helpful host.
Super cute flat in an great location for Paris. The flat is perfect to explore Le Marais as it is close to lots of bars and restaurants. The space is perfect for two people! It has all the mod cons that you might need and it was very clean.
Appartamento molto originale. Piccolo ma dotato di tutti i confort. Situato in pieno marais. Grazie anche a Philippe che è stato gentilissimo e disponibile.
Philippe is very kind, the apartment is cozy and warm on winter time, in a perfect location...
Phillips was super easy and fun. Great place an location. It doesn't get more romantic.
Appartamento delizioso, in posizione strategica nel cuore del Marais. Silenzioso e confortevole. Letti comodissimi. Philippe un padrone di casa fantastico e (website hidden) è stato di aiuto poter lasciare i bagagli nell'appartamento fino al momento della partenza. Proprio sotto l'appartamento ci sono dei locali fantastici. Un week end perfetto grazie a questa scelta indovinata!

Unser verlängertes Paris-Wochenende war einfach großartig! Die Wohnung von Philippe ist vollkommen ausreichend für 2, Bad und Küche sind sehr gut ausgestattet, WLAN war hilfreich für die Routenplanung. Man ist super angebunden: zu den U-Bahn Stationen Falguière und Duroc ist es nicht sehr weit (ca. 150m / 500m), ca. 5 Stationen nach Notre Dame. Alles weitere auch nicht weit entfernt. Ein Supermarkt, Restaurants und Kneipen sind um die Ecke. Trotzdem ist es in der Straße sehr ruhig, nur die Metro hört man manchmal (wenn man drauf achtet - die letzte fährt um 0:30 Uhr). Einziges Manko: Die Schlafcouch, die zwar seeehr bequem ist, quietscht sehr laut bei jeder Bewegung. Ein bisschen Öl könnte hier helfen (Tipp an den Besitzer ;-) ). Ansonsten: Philippe ist sehr nett und zuvorkommend, hat viele Tipps gegeben und auch gedruckt hinterlassen. Gerne wieder!"

L'appartement est coquet et charmant. Il est bien placé dans un quartier calme et agréable. Il contient les équipements nécessaires pour passer un bon séjour. La literie est propre et agréable. Nous y avons passé un excellent moment. Notre hôte nous a conseillé un marché pittoresque à proximité
Great spot to enjoy this stylish part of town, and in easy reach of major sights. Cool and compact apartment, great for a short break. Hosts really helpful.
We enjoyed our stay at this quaint apartment in a great location. Philippe was very friendly and made us feel welcome. We recommend this apartment to everyone. thank you Philippe!
The apartment is so sweet. I loved it. I really loved it. Paris is grand. The Marais is filled with little shops with everything you could ever want. Personally, I felt safer here than I do in Boston, and I live in Boston. Philippe is the best host ever, I fell in luv. I would and will go back as often as I can.
Beautiful mini apartment in a fabulous neighborhood. Perfect.
Charming little apartment situated on the 5th floor of typical Parisien building. Great location, only 5 minute walk away from Rue de Froissart metro stop. We arrived early before the previous guests had departed so our host arranged for his friend in the same building to look after our bags. We met our host later on that day and he gave us the keys and showed us around apartment, which was in prefect condition. There are a lot of stairs up to the apartment so if you have knee problems or if you are old, this apartment may not be suitable for you. Also, any noises coming from the toilet can be heard quite clearly throughout the apartment, so you might want to be quite comfortable with whoever you stay with here! Overall though, a great apartment
I had never been to Paris and this apt was in a great location to walk and take the metro from. Philippe was easy to coordinate with for checkin and check out. Thanks!
Very nice contact and a small - but extremely lovely! - apartment! Clean, calm, and old Paris-style classy. The location is perfect for going anywhere by foot or by metro, there are tons of restaurants, cafés, brasseries and shops right outside the door. I would recommend this place to anyone fit enough to climb 5 flights of stairs.
Great place! Real good value for money! Super kind host and, although a very small space, it has everything you (website hidden)'s very quite and clean and with a beautiful authentic Parisian touch; you feel like you live in in Paris. The Marais is the hottest area at the moment, so you won't regret staying here. Philippe even recommended me his favourite restaurant (you have to ask him ; ) which was sublime. I traveled alone and felt completely safe and relaxed, which is absolutely worth the climbing of a few stairs. Just book it

Thank you for a good stay. The location of the apartment is excellent and the apartment was exactly what I needed for a quick and comfortable stay in Paris. Philippe was very helpful.
Philippe's flat is great. Very clean, new and charmant. It's in the heart of Paris, in the lovely (email hidden)ly neighborhood crowded with nice cafés, restaurants, great shops and museums. Philippe was very kind, the appartment has a coffee and a tea machine available, we enjoyed having breakfast at home in the morning. We are looking forward to go back to Paris!
We went to Paris to watch our son in the Marathon and had a sunny weekend in this wonderfully light and artfully decorated apartment. We felt wonderfully at home and comfortable among the artworks and velvet and slept deeply on the excellent beds. A great location and a wonderful space from which to venture forth and explore the cultural richness fo Paris.
Philippe was very attentive and helpful! And the location of the apartment is excellent! Thanks very much for everything!"

We felt so at ease knowing he would take us to his apartment. The apartment is even better than is pictured! It was amazing and we walked everywhere. But if you prefer to take the city bus it is located just one block down the street at no cost. We absolutely recommend this location! All bedding, towels, music he provides, wifi, and many other extras were better than a five star hotel.
Unser verlängertes Paris-Wochenende war einfach großartig! Die Wohnung von Philippe ist vollkommen ausreichend für 2, Bad und Küche sind sehr gut ausgestattet, WLAN war hilfreich für die Routenplanung. Man ist super angebunden: zu den U-Bahn Stationen Falguière und Duroc ist es nicht sehr weit (ca. 150m / 500m), ca. 5 Stationen nach Notre Dame. Alles weitere auch nicht weit entfernt. Ein Supermarkt, Restaurants und Kneipen sind um die Ecke. Trotzdem ist es in der Straße sehr ruhig, nur die Metro hört man manchmal (wenn man drauf achtet - die letzte fährt um 0:30 Uhr). Einziges Manko: Die Schlafcouch, die zwar seeehr bequem ist, quietscht sehr laut bei jeder Bewegung. Ein bisschen Öl könnte hier helfen (Tipp an den Besitzer ;-) ). Ansonsten: Philippe ist sehr nett und zuvorkommend, hat viele Tipps gegeben und auch gedruckt hinterlassen. Gerne wieder!
Appartement très propre, rénové depuis peu! Idéal pour une personne ou un couple! Parfait!
Très bel appartement, très bien situé. Grande disponibilité de Philippe qui est un hôte exemplaire que nous vous recommandons sans hésiter! Merci encore pour tout!
Philippe was very kind and available and everything went ok during our stay. The app is confortable and very clean. Very central and yet quiet! We would book again.
I love the apt. Very clean and charming. Philippe helped we with my bags which I sent over before I got in to Paris. I recommend the place. Angelina
Le studio est bien situé et propre.
Excellent Apartment - central to Montparnasse - St Germain. Right beside the metro and a 5 min walk to the Air France Bus to CDG. Clean Comfy and great broadband. Nice restaurant recommendations from the host. I was working in the Port de Versaille for an exhibition and it was only 10 min away. Will be staying again for sure.
GREAT location, nice host but seriously over priced for the TINY space with a squeaky pull out couch (I payed 119EUR/night). But then again it was Valentine's day, so maybe that was the reason. For 79EUR (as advertised) it's a fair deal.
Super Séjour ! Super appart ! Super Acceuil ! Merci Philippe !!! Anso et Alex
We had a lovely time in Philippe's cute little Paris apartment! It is situated in a sweet neighborhood within comfortable walking distance to the tube and major sights like Notre Dame and the Louvre. It felt that we were """"living"""" in Paris instead of just being a tourist. The beds were comfortable and the WiFi was good. Philippe was a wonderful host! He helped us find the apartment when we got lost, helped us drag our 3 very large suitcases up 4 flights of stairs and even called a taxi for our departure since I couldn't pronounce the street names. The shower and toilet were a bit small and tricky to manage, but nothing too difficult. Overall we had a fabulous time and I would highly recommend staying here to anyone in the future!
This was my first time using airbnb and what a great experience. The apartment was just as it was presented on the site and exactly what I was looking for. The host was very helpful,the appartment was clean, and we slept like babes each night with the window open on our top floor abode. the apartment was just a 10 minute walk away from Notre Dame. I was able to make breakfast each morning on our petite stove top. Thank you again. We would definitely stay again.
This apartment although small is great. Ideally located in the heart of the Marais it's newly refurbished and nicely done.
Phillipe, Thanks so much for the lovely stay. The Marais location was prefect and the apartment was exactly what we needed for a quick and comfortable stay in Paris. I especially loved the loft view of rooftops! Thanks again, Carolyn
Anne fell in love with Philippe's apartment and now wants to move to Paris and live in it! It's very large and has big windows with lots of light. It's also in a great location. Less than 10 minutes walk to the Censier Daubenton station on the #7 Metro line which goes right to the Louvre. About a 15 minute walk to the RER B line which goes directly to the Gare du Nord (Railroad station) and all the way to CDG airport. And best of all, it's a 5 minute walk to the wonderful Rue Mouffetard, one of the oldest streets in Paris, with a bustling, permanent street market. If you love food, you'll love Rue Mouffetard! Philippe gave us great directions on the best way to get to and from his apartment. He met us there with two sets of keys, as requested, and communication with him was easy. We'll definitely be contacting him again on our next trip to Paris.

The bed and the additional matress are super comfortable, that compensates the small shower, the balcony with afternoon sun is lovely and the location is great. Thank you, Jane!
After a little bit of difficulty finding the place, my sister and I both agreed that we could not have stumbled upon a more perfect location to spend our week in Paris! Jane waited for us so we could grab the keys, even though we were several hours late (problems at the airport, and then difficulty navigating Paris -- protip, the street signs are on the buildings), so she is basically a saint. The apartment is tiny and lovely (the bathroom is seriously small, but totally serviceable), and what it doesn't have in spaciousness it more than makes up for with its incredible balcony and prime location. It was perfect for us because it was near so many awesome things (a 30min walk to the Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysees, and 40min to Notre Dame), and a few Metro stops that will get you anywhere else your heart desires. As an added bonus, three blocks away on Rue Babylone there is an EXCELLENT coffee shop (a rarity in Paris) called Cafe Coutume. My sister and I, desperate for some good joe, went there every morning -- and on our last visit, the manager knew our drinks and had them ready for us before we even ordered. Such a wonderful experience, and a fantastic way to end our stay.
Good apartment and location, however, the host was an hour late to give me the keys and she rushed us out when leaving. Not the best.
This was a great apartment. We really loved the area, it was convenient for both Vaneau and Duroc metro stations and close to the centre of Paris. It was comfortable and it felt very Parisian. The kitchen is small but well equipped and balcony was lovely!
Jane was a terrific hostess: our incoming flight was very delayed but she patiently waited for us to get there. The apartment was perfect for us - parent and teen, who is something of a homebody. We could read on the sofa or balcony, cook in the (small and improvisation-inspiring) kitchen and even spend a couple of evenings at home happily. The location is perfect too for walking around. Thank you!
We stayed in the apartment for 3 days. Prior to our arrival I emailed Jane to ask directions from the station to which she replied promptly, I also asked if there was a hair dryer and Jane said she could supply one, which she did. The apartment is in a very good location. The neighbourhood is safe and quiet. There are all of the shops you need just at the end of the road, 2 minutes away, as is the Metro station. Jane met us at the apartment on arrival and handed us the keys and explained the wi-fi etc. The living room is very small. The bathroom is tiny. The bedroom a reasonable size and the kitchen is only adequate for 1 person to be in. Pros: Location, the balcony, the neighbourhood, the apartment is clean and the bed is super comfortable. Things you should know: there is no kettle, toaster, frying pan, microwave or oven. The kitchen is a sink, 2 rings, a cooker hood and a fridge. Ample crockery and cutlery is supplied along with 2 saucepans, a grater, colander and chopping board. There is no TV. Lots of tea towels and towels are supplied. Its quite a hike up a spiral staircase to the apartment. The shower is very small, I'm small but my husband is almost 6ft and found it awkward to turn around in the shower. It's peaceful and after 2 full days of sightseeing a great nights sleep was most welcome. If I visit Paris again I would prefer a few more amenities and a little more room, having said that it was clean, Jane was very pleasant and for location alone this apartment is worth using.
We had a very pleasant experience! We arrived in the morning, and Jane offered to let us leave our bags with her and go explore the city while we waited to check in. She gave us lots of ideas as to what we could see and do, and showed us where the best spots are on a map. She is very sweet and kind, and has lived in Paris for 25 years. The flat has a good view and a balcony. It is located on a quiet but safe feeling street. There is a beautiful courtyard downstairs at the entrance. The bedding was very comfortable and the apartment charming! Bon voyage! :)
I LOVED the location of this apartment. Very, very quiet, but one block away from all sorts of interesting shops and cafés and within walking distance of la Grande Epicerie, which is always one of my favorite time-wasters. The apartment itself is very small, but manageable if you're just one or two people who like each other very much. The terrace was fabulous, as well. It was fun to sit out there and watch les Invalides light up as the sun set! Only issue would be that the hot water really doesn't last, so you have to be quite quick when you shower. Also, there's no elevator and it's on the 6th floor I believe, so if you have a suitcase just be prepared.
Excellent stay in this beautiful little apartment. Jane was a great host; very welcoming, helpful and happy to help make our stay the best it could be. Though the apartment was very small it was ideal for a short stay - quintessentially French in a lovely old building with a fantastic location. We didn't plan to be in the apartment much but with nice weather it was lovely to sit on the balcony and have some petit déjeuner in the sun. The location was probably the best feature, as it was very close to 2 metro stations on different lines, as well as being only a short walk from the Latin quarter and in the other direction only 15 mins or so to Les Invalides and on to the Eiffel Tower and Trocadero etc. Overall a fantastic experience - thank you to Jane for making our stay such a pleasant and memorable one. Highly recommended.
A quintessentially Parisian hide away, with a great balcony. My wife and I had a magical weekend in Paris made all the better by choosing to stay at Jane's cozy and romantic apartment. Jane was lovely, kind, helpful and a good consul when planning those details that make a visit to this beautiful city extra special. The area is not over run by fellow tourists so you get to deal with everyday Parisians, who are engaging, pleasant and helpful. Unlike some previous visits to the more tourist centric hotel and business districts. Access up to the 4th floor apartment could be a little challenging for a few, but a gentle walk up is really worth it. The bathroom is a bit of a squeeze, But then again my 6month pregnant wife and I are in the 6ft department, so not standard issue ! The good sized bedroom / bed was great, we slept well and awoke on the Sunday to gentle, distant church bells ringing, ate breakfast in the living room, next the sunny balcony - doors open. The fresh bread, cheese, meats and coffee all gathered in a 20 minute visit to the little shops not more than a couple of hundred yards from the apartment. All put together easily in the snug kitchen. All in all, a charming host who has a """"charming little flat in the center"""" of Paris. Try this place out, its a no brainer. We also discovered that Jane has other, lower level, apartment options in Paris. So once the baby arrives we will be back to visit one with a push chair in (website hidden). TRANSPORT - Your no more than 10 minutes walk from the river and most left bank attractions, but If you don't want to walk, connections are so easy. Metro station Vaneau is 3 minutes walk from the apartment. To get to Gard du Nord stn ( London trains ) its around 20 minutes or a taxi is 12/15 euros. But just like any big city, traffic can be a nightmare in Paris on weekdays so beware.
Fantastic stay with jane. Lovely apartment, lovely part of Paris and ideal hosting. Could not have asked for anything more.
Staying at Jane's was like Staying At home but with an amazing breakfast everyday. We felt really comfortable and she is a sweet person. We will defenitely be back to Jane's in our next trip
Chambre très calme et hôtesse extrêmement accueillante. Pour ma première expérience Airbnb, ce fut une réussite.
Jane is a nice, elegant lazy. Her house is well decorated like an art museum! And the bed is super cozy!! I love the proud cat named Max:) Good location ,closed to 2 metro stations. Nothing to complain.
Quelle hôte exceptionnelle! Le petit déjeuner qu'elle avait préparé lui ressemble: bio, beau, bon…….danois! Toujours disponible pour partager ses adresses, ses bons plans, génial!!!
excellent séjour chez Jane, c'est mon 2eme !!! Jane est une excellente hôtesse, la chambre est très confortable et calme le petit déjeuner est super
J'ai passé une nuit chez Jane et j'ai apprécié l'accueil simple et chaleureux de Jane et de sa fille. J'ai passé un séjour très agréable et je l'en remercie.
Jane was a fantastic host and we had a lovely long weekend away staying in her apartment. If you want to really feel Paris, this is the place to stay. Great location, comfy bed, amazing breakfast, a perfect weekend away.
J'ai réservé la chambre chez Jane pour une escapade de mes parents à Paris. Je recommande vivement. Jane m'a appelé pour répondre à quelques questions avant que je ne réserve et m'a tenue informée à plusieurs reprises par téléphone, s'est montrée très accueillante avec mes parents (un GRAND MERCI Jane !) pour qu'ils passent un très agréable séjour (ce qui fut fait). Une très très bonne expérience à renouveler. Jane mange tak for din gæstfrihed
First airbnb experience at Jane's and i don't think i'll ever book a hotel anymore! Simply perfect: it felt like being home, personable, peaceful, yummy food, great value! Well done Jane!"

I didn't want to write down here negative things. But, I should say something for those who are looking for a host. I had very bad experience in Jane's house. I wouldn't trust the other's comments were very confident and positive on her hosting. Maybe I expected too much but, at least, she would explain she will be out of home during my journey. Nothing prepared; cleaned room, cleaned bathroom, breakfast The first day when I arrived at night, the other kind visitors explained us where is our room and We entered into the room, I was very surprised how the room was massy and felt someone stayed in the room. Some waste, someone's cloths... Even there is no room key even though there are other tourist. Fortunately, the other people are so kind but, how did I feel safe here. And there is no bread for breakfast, some of fruits that's all! Maybe, the others might have a great time ,however, I disappointed with this accommodation.
Merci beaucoup Jane ! Je ne peux être que ravie de mon séjour chez vous ! Vous êtes une hôte charmante, que je recommande ++++++++ ! 1000 merci pour TOUT !!! A bientôt j'espère ! :)))
Nous avons passé un excellent week end, l'appartement est très agréable et fonctionnel. Nous n'avons vu Jane qu'un court instant mais elle a été adorable et le petit déjeuner est un petit plus très sympa !
Merci infiniment Jane pour l'accueil assuré malgré les problèmes de réservation en ligne et de mon arrivée tardive. L'appartement est cosi, l'accueil sincère, le petit déjeuner avec ses fruits frais est exquis pour bien entamer sa journée. Et ce qui ne gâche rien, la literie est excellente ! Le quartier est calme, la proximité de la gare Montparnasse (et d'un excellent petit restaurant russe pour le soir) est un plus. Une adresse que je recommande !!
Jane est une personne charmante, tout comme son appartement. Je recommande
Jane, je te remercie pour ton commentaire. j'ai également beaucoup apprécié ton accueil. La chambre était accueillante et agréable, et le petit déjeuner parfait. Je recommande également Jane à tous ceux qui souhaitent faire une excursion parisienne!
Thanks Jane!
